^section Sequencing Patterns

## Intent

*Cause a series of sequential operations to appear instantaneous or
simultaneous.*

## Motivation

In their hearts, computers are <span name="sequential">sequential</span> beasts.
Their power comes from being able to break down the largest tasks into tiny
steps that can be performed one after another. Often, though, our users need to
see things occur in a single instantaneous step, or see multiple tasks performed
simultaneously.

<aside name="sequential">

With threading and multi-core architectures, this is becoming less true, but
even with several cores only a few operations are really running concurrently.

</aside>

A typical example, and one that every game engine must address, is rendering.
When the game draws the world the users see, it does so one piece at a time: the
mountains in the distance, the rolling hills, the trees, each in its turn. If
the user *watched* the view draw incrementally like that, the illusion of a
coherent world would be shattered. The scene must update smoothly and quickly,
displaying a series of complete frames, each appearing instantly.

Double buffering solves this problem, but to understand how, we first need to
review how a computer displays graphics.

### How computer graphics work (briefly)

A <span name="scan">video</span> display like a computer monitor draws one pixel
at a time. It sweeps across each row of pixels from left to right, and then
moves down to the next row. When it reaches the bottom right corner, it scans
back up to the top left and starts all over again. It does this so fast --
around sixty times a second -- that our eyes can't see the scanning. To us, it's
a single static field of colored pixels, an image.

<aside name="scan">

This explanation is, err, "simplified". If you're a low-level hardware person
and you're cringing right now, feel free to skip to the next section. You
already know enough to understand the rest of the chapter. If you *aren't* that
person, my goal here is to give you just enough context to understand the
pattern we'll discuss later.

</aside>

You can think of this process like a tiny hose that pipes pixels to the display.
Individual colors go into the back of the hose, and it sprays them out across
the display, one bit of color to each pixel in its turn. So how does the hose
know what colors go where?

In most computers, the answer is that it pulls them from a *framebuffer*. A
framebuffer is an array of pixels in memory, a chunk of RAM where each couple of
<span name="color">bytes</span> represents the color of a single pixel. As the
hose sprays across the display, it reads in the color values from this array,
one byte at a time.

<aside name="color">

The specific mapping between byte values and colors is described by the *pixel
format* and the *color depth* of the system. In most gaming consoles today, each
pixel gets 32 bits: eight each for the red, green and blue channels, and another
eight left over for various other purposes.

</aside>

In order to get our game to appear on screen, all we ultimately do is write to
that array. All of the crazy advanced graphics algorithms we have boil down to
just that: setting byte values in the framebuffer. But there's a little problem.

Earlier, I said computers are sequential. If the machine is executing a chunk of
our rendering code, we don't expect it to be doing anything else at the same
time. That's mostly accurate, but a couple of things *do* happen in the middle
of our program running. One of those is that the video display will be reading
from the framebuffer *constantly* while our game runs. This can cause a problem
for us.

Let's say we want a happy face to appear on screen. Our program starts looping
through the framebuffer, coloring pixels. What we don't realize is that the
video driver is pulling from the framebuffer right as we're writing to it. As it
scans across the pixels we've written, our face starts to appear, but then it
outpaces us and moves into pixels we haven't written yet. The result is
*tearing:* a hideous visual bug where you see half of something drawn on screen.

<span name="tearing"></span>

<img src="images/double-buffer-tearing.png" />

<aside name="tearing">

We start drawing pixels just as the video driver starts reading from the
framebuffer (Fig. 1). The video driver eventually catches up to the renderer and
then races past it to pixels we haven't written yet (Fig. 2). We finish drawing
(Fig. 3), but the driver doesn't catch those new pixels.

The result (Fig. 4) is that the user sees half of the drawing. The name
"tearing" comes from the fact that it looks like the bottom half was torn off.

</aside>

This is why we need this pattern. Our program renders the pixels one at a time,
but we need the display driver to see them all at once -- one frame the face
isn't there, the next one it is. Double buffering solves this. I'll explain how
by analogy.

### Act 1, Scene 1

Imagine our users are watching a play, produced by ourselves. As scene one ends
and scene two starts, we need to change the stage setting. If we just have the
stagehands run on after the scene and start dragging props around, the illusion
of a coherent place will be broken. We could dim the lights while we do that
(which of course, is what real theaters do), but the audience still knows
*something* is going on then. We want there to be no gap in time between scenes.

So, with a bit of real estate we come up with this clever solution: We build
<span name="stage">*two*</span> stages set up so the audience can see both. Each
has its own set of lights. We'll call them stage A and B. Scene one is shown on
stage A. Meanwhile, stage B is dark and the stagehands are setting up scene two
on it. As soon as scene one ends, we cut the lights on stage A, and bring them
up on stage B. The audience looks to the new stage and scene two begins
immediately.

At the same time, our stagehands are over on the now darkened stage *A*,
striking scene one and setting up scene *three*. As soon as scene two ends, we
switch the lights again back to stage A. We continue this process for the entire
play, using the darkened stage as a work area where we can set up the next
scene. Every scene transition, we just toggle the lights between the two stages.
Our audience gets a continuous performance with no delay between scenes. They
never see a stagehand.

<aside name="stage">

Using a half-silvered mirror and some very smart layout, you could actually
build this so that the two stages appear to the audience in the same *place*. As
soon as the lights switch, they would be looking at a different stage, but would
never have to change where they look. Building this is left as an exercise for
the reader.

</aside>

### Back to the graphics

That is <span name="sync">exactly</span> how double buffering works, and this
process underlies the rendering system of just about every game you've ever
seen. Instead of a single framebuffer, we have *two*. One of them represents the
current frame, stage A in our analogy. It's the one the video hardware is
reading from. The GPU can scan through it as much as it wants whenever it wants.

<aside name="sync">

Not *all* games and consoles do this, though. Older and simpler consoles where
memory is limited actually carefully sync their drawing to the video refresh
instead. It's tricky.

</aside>

Meanwhile, our rendering code is writing to the *other* buffer. This is our
darkened stage B. When our rendering code is done drawing the scene, it switches
the lights by *swapping* the buffers. This tells the video hardware to start
reading from the second buffer now instead of the first one. As long as it times
that switch at the end of a refresh, we won't get any tearing, and the entire
scene appears all at once.

Meanwhile, the old framebuffer is now available for use. We start rendering the
next frame onto it. Voil&agrave;!

## The Pattern

A **buffered class** encapsulates a **buffer**: a piece of state that can be
modified. This buffer is edited incrementally, but we want all outside code to
see the edit as a single atomic change. To do this, the class keeps *two*
instances of the buffer, a **next buffer** and a **current buffer**.

When information is read *from* a buffer, it is always from the *current*
buffer. When information is *written* to a buffer, it occurs on the *next*
buffer. When the changes are complete, a **swap** operation swaps the next and
current buffers instantly so that the new buffer is now publicly visible. The
old current buffer is now available to be reused as the new next buffer.

## When to Use It

This pattern is one of those ones where you'll know when you need it. If you
have a system that lacks double buffering, it will probably look visibly wrong
(tearing, etc.) or will behave incorrectly. But saying, "you'll know when you
need it" doesn't give you much to go on. More specifically, this pattern is
appropriate when all of these are true:

 *  We have some state that is being modified incrementally.

 *  That same state may be accessed in the middle of modification.

 *  We want to prevent the code that's accessing the state from
    seeing the work-in-progress.

 *  We want to be able to read the state and we don't want to have to
    wait while it's being written.

## Keep in Mind

Unlike larger architectural patterns, double buffering exists at a lower
implementation level. Because of this, it has fewer consequences for the rest of
the codebase -- most of the game won't even be aware of the difference. There
are a couple of caveats, though.

### The swap itself takes time

Double-buffering requires a *swap* step once the state is done being modified.
That operation must be atomic -- no code can access *either* state while they
are being swapped. Often, the swap is as quick as assigning a pointer, but if it
takes longer than it does to modify the state to begin with, then we haven't
helped ourselves at all.

### We have to have two buffers

The other consequence of this pattern is memory usage. As its name implies, the
pattern requires you to keep *two* copies of your state in memory at all times.
On memory-constrained devices, this can be a heavy price to pay. If you can't
afford two buffers, you may have to look into other ways to ensure your state
isn't being accessed during modification.

## Sample Code

Now that we've got the theory, let's see how it works in practice. We'll write a
very bare-bones graphics system that lets us draw pixels on a frame buffer. In
most consoles and PCs, this low-level part of the graphics system is provided by
the video driver, but hand-implementing it here will let us see what's going on.
First up is the buffer itself:

^code 1

It has basic operations for clearing the entire buffer to a default color, and
setting the color of an individual pixel. It also has a function, `getPixels()`,
to expose the raw array of memory holding the pixel data. We won't see this in
the example, but the video driver will call that function frequently to stream
memory from the buffer onto the screen.

We wrap this raw buffer in a `Scene` class. It's job here is to render something
by making a bunch of `draw()` calls on its buffer:

<span name="draw"></span>

^code 2

<aside name="draw">

Specifically, it draws this artistic masterpiece:

<img src="images/double-buffer-face.png" width="240" />

</aside>

Every frame, the game tells the scene to draw. The scene clears the buffer and
then draws a bunch of pixels, one at a time. It also provides access to the
internal buffer through `getBuffer()` so that the video driver can get to it.

This seems pretty straightforward, but if we leave it like this, we'll run into
problems. The trouble is that the video driver can call `getPixels()` on the
buffer at *any* point in time, even here:

^code 3

When that happens, the user will see the eyes of the face, but the mouth will
disappear for a single frame. The next frame, it could get interrupted at some
other point. The end result is horribly flickering graphics. We'll fix this with
double buffering:

^code 4

Now `Scene` has two buffers, stored in the `buffers_` array. We don't directly
reference them from the array. Instead, there are two members, `next_` and
`current_`, that point into that array. When we draw, we draw onto the next
buffer, referenced by `next_`. When the video driver needs to get at the pixels,
it always accesses the *other* buffer through `current_`.

This way, the video driver never sees the buffer that we're working on. The only
remaining piece of the puzzle is the call to `swap()` when the scene is done
drawing the frame. That swaps the two buffers by simply switching the `next_`
and `current_` references. The next time the video driver calls `getBuffer()`,
it will now get the new buffer we just finished drawing and put our recently
drawn buffer onscreen. No more tearing or unsightly glitches.

### Not just for graphics

The core problem that double buffering solves is state being accessed while it's
being modified. There are two common causes of this. We've covered the first one
with our graphics example: the state is directly accessed from code on another
thread or interrupt.

There is another equally common cause, though: when the code *doing the
modification* is accessing the same state that it's modifying. This can manifest
in a variety of places, especially physics and AI where you have entities
interacting with each other. Double-buffering is often helpful here too.

### Artificial unintelligence

Let's say we're building the behavioral system for, of all things, a game based
on slapstick comedy. The game has a stage containing a bunch of actors that run
around and get up to various hijinks and shenanigans. Here's our base actor:

^code 5

Every frame, the game is responsible for calling <span
name="update">`update()`</span> on it so that it has a chance to do some
processing. Critically, from the user's perspective, *all actors should appear
to update simultaneously*.

<aside name="update">

This is an example of the <a class="pattern" href="update-method.html">Update
Method</a> pattern.

</aside>

Actors can also interact with each other, if by "interacting", we mean "they can
slap each other around." When updating, the actor can call `slap()` on another
actor to slap it, and call `wasSlapped()` to determine if it has been slapped.

The actors need a stage where they can interact, so let's build that:

^code 6

It lets us add actors, and provides a single `update()` call that updates each
actor. Even though actors appear to move simultaneously to the user, internally
they are updated one at a time.

The only other point to note is that each actor's "slapped" state is cleared
immediately after updating. This is so that an actor only responds to a given
slap once.

To get things going, let's define a concrete actor subclass. Our comedian here
is pretty simple. He faces a single actor. Whenever he gets slapped -- by
anyone -- he responds by slapping the actor he faces.

^code 7

Now, let's throw some comedians on a stage and see what happens. We'll set up
three comedians, each facing the next. The last one will face the first, in a
big circle:

^code 8

The resulting stage is set up a bit like the following image shows. The arrows
show who is facing who, and the numbers show their index in the stage's array:

<img src="images/double-buffer-slaps-1.png" />

We'll slap Harry to get things going and see what happens when we start
processing:

^code 9

Remember that the `update()` function in Stage updates each actor in turn, so if
we step through the code, we'll find that the following occurs:

    Stage updates actor 0 (Harry)
      Harry was slapped, so he slaps Baldy
    Stage updates actor 1 (Baldy)
      Baldy was slapped, so he slaps Chump
    Stage updates actor 2 (Chump)
      Chump was slapped, so he slaps Harry
    Stage update ends

So, in a single frame, our initial slap on Harry has propagated through all of
the comedians. Now, to mix things up a bit, let's say we reorder the comedians
within the stage's array, but leave them still facing each other the same way.

<img src="images/double-buffer-slaps-2.png" />

We'll leave the rest of the stage setup alone, but replace the chunk of code
where we add the actors to the stage with this:

^code 10

Let's see what happens when we run our experiment again:

    Stage updates actor 0 (Chump)
      Chump was not slapped, so he does nothing
    Stage updates actor 1 (Baldy)
      Baldy was not slapped, so he does nothing
    Stage updates actor 2 (Harry)
      Harry was slapped, so he slaps Baldy
    Stage update ends

Uh, oh. Totally different. The problem is straightforward. When we
update the actors, we modify their "slapped" states, the exact same
state we also *read* during the update. Because of this, changes to
that state early in the update affect <span name="cascade">later</span> parts of that *same*
update step.

<aside name="cascade">

If you continue to update the stage, you'll see the slaps gradually
cascade through the actors, one per frame. In the first frame, Harry
slaps Baldy. In the next frame, Baldy slaps Chump, and so on.

</aside>

The ultimate result is that an actor may respond to being slapped on
either the *same* frame as the slap or the *next* frame, based
entirely on how the two actors happen to be ordered on the stage. This
violates our requirement that actors need to appear to run in
parallel: the order that they update within a single frame shouldn't
matter.

### Buffered slaps

Fortunately, our Double Buffer pattern can help. This time, instead of
having two copies of a monolithic "buffer" object, we'll be buffering
at a much finer granularity: each actor's "slapped" state:

^code 11

Instead of a single `slapped_` state, each actor now has two. Just
like the previous graphics example, the current state is used for
reading, and the next state is used for writing.

The `reset()` function has been replaced with `swap()`. Now, right
before clearing the swap state, it copies the next state into the
current one, making it the new current state. This also requires a
small change in `Stage`:

^code 12

The `update()` function now updates all of the actors and *then* swaps
all of their states.

The end result of this is that an actor will only see a slap on the
frame *after* it was actually slapped. This way, no matter what order
they appear in the stage's array, they will behave the same. As far as the user or any outside code can tell, all of the actors update simultaneously within a frame.

## Design Decisions

The Double Buffer pattern is pretty straightforward, and the examples
we've seen so far cover most of the variations you're likely to
encounter. There are two main decisions that come up when implementing
it.

### How are the buffers swapped?

The swap operation is the most critical step of the process since we
must lock out all reading and modification of both buffers while it's
occurring. To get the best performance, we want this to happen as
quickly as possible.

 *  **Swap pointers or references to the buffer:**

    This is how our graphics example works, and is the most common
    solution for double-buffering graphics.

     *  *It's fast.* Regardless of how big the buffer is, the swap is simply a
        couple of pointer assignments. It's hard to beat that for speed and
        simplicity.

     *  *Outside code cannot store persistent pointers to the buffer.* This is
        the main limitation. Since we don't actually move the *data*, what we're
        essentially doing is periodically telling the rest of the codebase to
        look somewhere else for the buffer, like in our original stage analogy.
        This means that the rest of the codebase can't store pointers directly
        to data within the buffer: they may be pointing at the wrong one a
        moment later.

        This can be particularly troublesome on a system where the video driver
        expects the framebuffer to always be at a fixed location in memory. In
        that case, we won't be able to use this option.

     *  *Existing data on the buffer will be from two frames ago, not the last
        frame.* Successive frames are drawn on alternating buffers, with no data
        copied between them, like so:

            :::text
            Frame 1 drawn on buffer A
            Frame 2 drawn on buffer B
            Frame 3 drawn on buffer A
            ...

        You'll note that when we go to draw the third frame, the data already on
        the buffer is from frame *one*, not the more recent second frame. In
        most cases, this isn't an issue -- we usually just clear the whole
        buffer right before drawing. But, if we intend to <span
        name="blur">reuse</span> some of the existing data on the buffer, it's
        important to take into account that that data will be a frame older than
        we might expect.

        <aside name="blur">

        One classic use of old framebuffer data is simulating motion blur. The
        current frame is blended with a bit of the previously rendered frame, to
        make a resulting image that looks more like what a real camera captures.

        </aside>

 *  **Copy the data between the buffers:**

    If we can't just repoint users to the other buffer, the only other option is
    to actually copy the data from the next frame to the current frame. This is
    how our slapstick comedians work. In that case, we chose this way because
    the state -- a single boolean flag -- doesn't take any longer to copy than a
    pointer to the buffer would.

     *  *Data on the next buffer is only a single frame old.* This is the nice
        thing about copying the data as opposed to ping-ponging back and forth
        between the two buffers. If we need access to previous buffer data, this
        will give us more up-to-date data to work with.

     *  *Swapping can take more time.* This, of course, is the big negative
        point. Our swap operation now means copying the entire buffer in memory.
        If the buffer is large, like an entire framebuffer, it can take a
        significant chunk of time to do this. Since nothing can read or write to
        *either* buffer while this is happening, that's a big limitation.

### What is the granularity of the buffer?

The other question is how the buffer itself is organized: as a single monolithic
chunk of data, or distributed among a collection of objects. Our graphics
example uses the former, and the actors use the latter.

Most of the time, the nature of what you're buffering will lead to the answer,
but there's some flexibility. For example, our actors could have all stored
their messages in a single message block that they all reference into by their
index.

 *  **If the buffer is monolithic:**

     *  <p>*Swapping is simpler.* Since there is only one pair of buffers, a
        single swap does it. If you can swap by changing pointers, then you can
        swap the entire buffer, regardless of size, with just a couple of
        assignments.</p>

 *  **If many objects have a piece of data:**

     *  *Swapping is slower.* In order to swap, we need to iterate through the
        entire collection of objects, telling each one to swap.

        In our comedian example, that was OK since we needed to clear the next
        slap state anyway -- every piece of buffered state needed to be touched
        each frame. If we don't need to otherwise touch the old buffer, there's
        a simple optimization we can do to get the same performance of a
        monolithic buffer while distributing the buffer across multiple objects.

        The idea is to get the "current" and "next" pointer concept and apply it
        to each of our objects by turning them into object-relative *offsets*.
        Like so:

        ^code 13

        Actors access their current slap state by using `current_` to index into
        the state array. The next state is always the other index in the array,
        so we can calculate that with `next()`. Swapping the state just
        alternates the `current_` index. The clever bit is that `swap()` is now
        a *static* function: it only needs to be called once, and *every*
        actor's state will be swapped.

## See Also

 *  <p>You can find this pattern in use in almost every graphics API out there.
    OpenGL has `swapBuffers()`. Microsoft's XNA framework swaps the framebuffers
    within its `endDraw()` function.</p>
