<h1>State</h1>
<h1 class="book"><a href="/">Game Programming Patterns</a><span class="section"><a href="design-patterns-revisited.html">Design Patterns Revisited</a></span></h1>
<p>Confession time: I went a little overboard and packed way too much into this
chapter. It&#8217;s ostensibly about the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern" class="gof-pattern">State</a>
design pattern, but I can&#8217;t talk about that and games without going into the
more fundamental concept of <em>finite state machines</em> (or &#8220;FSMs&#8221;). But then once I
went there, I figured I might as well introduce <em>hierarchical state machines</em>
and <em>pushdown automata</em>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot to cover, so to keep things as short as possible, the code samples
here leave out a few details that you&#8217;ll have to fill in on your own. I hope
they&#8217;re still clear enough for you to get the big picture.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t feel sad if you&#8217;ve never heard of a state machine. While well known to
<span name="two-camps">AI and compiler</span> hackers, they aren&#8217;t that familiar
to other programming circles. I think they should be more widely known, so I&#8217;m
going to throw them at a different kind of problem here.</p>
<aside name="two-camps">

<p>This pairing echoes the early days of artificial intelligence. In the &rsquo;50s and
&rsquo;60s, much of AI research was focused on language processing. Many of the
techniques compilers now use for parsing programming languages were invented for
parsing human languages.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re working on a little side-scrolling platformer. Our job is to implement the
heroine that is the player&#8217;s avatar in the game world. That means making her
respond to user input. Push the B button and she should jump. Simple enough:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">handleInput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Input</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Spot the bug?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing to prevent &#8220;air jumping&#8221;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;keep hammering B while she&#8217;s in the
air, and she will float forever. The simple <span name="landing">fix</span> is to
add an <code>isJumping_</code> Boolean field to <code>Heroine</code> that tracks when she&#8217;s jumping,
and then do:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">handleInput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Input</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>There should also be code that sets <code>isJumping_</code> back to <code>false</code> when the
heroine touches the ground. I&#8217;ve omitted that here for brevity&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>Bug hunting time again. Find it?</p>
<p>We check that you can&#8217;t air jump while jumping, but not while diving. Yet
another field&#8230;</p>
<p>Something is clearly <span name="se">wrong</span> with our approach. Every time
we touch this handful of code, we break something. We need to add a bunch more
moves&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;we haven&#8217;t even added <em>walking</em> yet&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but at this rate, it will
collapse into a heap of bugs before we&#8217;re done with it.</p>
<aside name="se">

<p>Those coders you idolize who always seem to create flawless code aren&#8217;t simply
superhuman programmers. Instead, they have an intuition about which <em>kinds</em> of
code are error-prone, and they steer away from them.</p>
<p>Complex branching and mutable state&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;fields that change over time&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;are two
of those error-prone kinds of code, and the examples above have both.</p>
</aside>

<h2><a href="#finite-state-machines-to-the-rescue" name="finite-state-machines-to-the-rescue">Finite State Machines to the Rescue</a></h2>
<p>In a fit of frustration, you sweep everything off your desk except a pen and
paper and start drawing a flowchart. You draw a box for each thing the heroine
can be doing: standing, jumping, ducking, and diving. When she can respond to a
button press in one of those states, you draw an arrow from that box, label it
with that button, and connect it to the state she changes to.</p>
<p><img src="images/state-flowchart.png"/></p>
<p>Congratulations, you&#8217;ve just created a <em>finite state machine</em>. These came out of
a branch of computer science called <em>automata theory</em> whose family of data
structures also includes the famous Turing machine. FSMs are the simplest member
of that family.</p>
<p>The <span name="adventure">gist</span> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have a fixed <em>set of states</em> that the machine can be in. For our
    example, that&#8217;s standing, jumping, ducking, and diving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The machine can only be in <em>one</em> state at a time. Our heroine can&#8217;t be
    jumping and standing simultaneously. In fact, preventing that is one reason
    we&#8217;re going to use an FSM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sequence of <em>inputs</em> or <em>events</em> is sent to the machine. In our example,
    that&#8217;s the raw button presses and releases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each state has a <em>set of transitions</em>, each associated with an input and
    pointing to a state. When an input comes in, if it matches a transition for
    the current state, the machine changes to the state that transition points
    to.</p>
<p>For example, pressing down while standing transitions to the ducking state. Pressing down while jumping transitions to diving. If no transition is defined for an input on the current state, the input is ignored.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In their pure form, that&#8217;s the whole banana: states, inputs, and transitions.
You can draw it out like a little flowchart. Unfortunately, the compiler doesn&#8217;t
recognize our scribbles, so how do we go about <em>implementing</em> one? The Gang of
Four&#8217;s State pattern is one method&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;which we&#8217;ll get to&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but let&#8217;s start simpler.</p>
<aside name="adventure">

<p>My favorite analogy for FSMs is the old text adventure games like Zork. You have
a world of rooms that are connected to each other by exits. You explore them by
entering commands like &#8220;go north&#8221;.</p>
<p>This maps directly to a state machine: Each room is a state. The room you&#8217;re in
is the current state. Each room&#8217;s exits are its transitions. The navigation
commands are the inputs.</p>
</aside>

<h2><a href="#enums-and-switches" name="enums-and-switches">Enums and Switches</a></h2>
<p>One problem our <code>Heroine</code> class has is some combinations of those Boolean fields
aren&#8217;t valid: <code>isJumping_</code> and <code>isDucking_</code> should never both be true, for
example. When you have a handful of flags where only one is <code>true</code> at a time,
that&#8217;s a hint that what you really want is an <code>enum</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, that <code>enum</code> is exactly the set of states for our FSM, so let&#8217;s
define that:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">State</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">STATE_STANDING</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">STATE_JUMPING</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">STATE_DUCKING</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">STATE_DIVING</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Instead of a bunch of flags, <code>Heroine</code> will just have one <code>state_</code> field. We
also flip the order of our branching. In the previous code, we switched on
input, <em>then</em> on state. This kept the code for handling one button press
together, but it smeared around the code for one state. We want to keep that
together, so we switch on state first. That gives us:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">handleInput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Input</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>This seems trivial, but it&#8217;s a real improvement over the previous code. We still
have some conditional branching, but we simplified the <span
name="invalid">mutable</span> state to a single field. All of the code for
handling a single state is now nicely lumped together. This is the simplest way
to implement a state machine and is fine for some uses.</p>
<aside name="invalid">

<p>In particular, the heroine can no longer be in an <em>invalid</em> state. With the
Boolean flags, some sets of values were possible but meaningless. With the <code>enum</code>,
each value is valid.</p>
</aside>

<p>Your problem may outgrow this solution, though. Say we want to add a move where
our heroine can duck for a while to charge up and unleash a special attack.
While she&#8217;s ducking, we need to track the charge time.</p>
<p>We add a <code>chargeTime_</code> field to <code>Heroine</code> to store how long the attack has
charged. Assume we already have an <span name="update"><code>update()</code></span> that
gets called each frame. In there, we add:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">state_</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">STATE_DUCKING</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">chargeTime_</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">chargeTime_</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">MAX_CHARGE</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>All in all, to add this charge attack, we had to modify two methods and add a
<code>chargeTime_</code> field onto <code>Heroine</code> even though it&#8217;s only meaningful while in
the ducking state. What we&#8217;d prefer is to have all of that code and data nicely
wrapped up in one place. The Gang of Four has us covered.</p>
<h2><a href="#the-state-pattern" name="the-state-pattern">The State Pattern</a></h2>
<p>For people deeply into the object-oriented mindset, every conditional <span
name="branch">branch</span> is an opportunity to use dynamic dispatch (in other
words a virtual method call in C++). I think you can go too far down that
rabbit hole. Sometimes an <code>if</code> is all you need.</p>
<aside name="branch">

<p>There&#8217;s a historical basis for this. Many of the original object-oriented
apostles like <em>Design Patterns</em>&#8216; Gang of Four, and <em>Refactoring</em>&#8216;s Martin Fowler
came from Smalltalk. There, <code>ifThen:</code> is just a method you invoke on the
condition, which is implemented differently by the <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> objects.</p>
</aside>

<p>But in our example, we&#8217;ve reached a tipping point where something
object-oriented is a better fit. That gets us to the State pattern. In the words
of the Gang of Four:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t tell us much. Heck, our <code>switch</code> does that. The concrete pattern
they describe looks like this when applied to our heroine:</p>
<h3><a href="#a-state-interface" name="a-state-interface">A state interface</a></h3>
<p>First, we define an interface for the state. Every bit of behavior that is
state-dependent&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;every place we had a <code>switch</code> before&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;becomes a virtual
method in that interface. For us, that&#8217;s <code>handleInput()</code> and <code>update()</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">HeroineState</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">HeroineState</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">handleInput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Input</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<h3><a href="#classes-for-each-state" name="classes-for-each-state">Classes for each state</a></h3>
<p>For each state, we define a class that implements the interface. Its methods
define the heroine&#8217;s behavior when in that state. In other words, take each <code>case</code>
from the earlier <code>switch</code> statements and move them into their state&#8217;s class. For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">DuckingState</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">HeroineState</span>

<p>Note that we also moved <code>chargeTime_</code> out of <code>Heroine</code> and into the <code>DuckingState</code>
class. This is great&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that piece of data is only meaningful while in that state,
and now our object model reflects that explicitly.</p>
<h3><a href="#delegate-to-the-state" name="delegate-to-the-state">Delegate to the state</a></h3>
<p>Next, we give the <code>Heroine</code> a pointer to her current state, lose each big <code>switch</code>, and delegate to the state instead:</p>
<p><span name="delegate"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Heroine</span>

<p>In order to &#8220;change state&#8221;, we just need to assign <code>state_</code> to point to a
different <code>HeroineState</code> object. That&#8217;s the State pattern in its entirety.</p>
<aside name="delegate">

<p>This looks like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern"
class="gof-pattern">Strategy</a> and <a href="type-object.html"
class="pattern">Type Object</a> patterns. In all three, you have a main object
that delegates to another subordinate one. The difference is <em>intent</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With Strategy, the goal is to <em>decouple</em> the main class from some portion of
    its behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With Type Object, the goal is to make a <em>number</em> of objects behave similarly
    by <em>sharing</em> a reference to the same type object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With State, the goal is for the main object to <em>change</em> its behavior by
    <em>changing</em> the object it delegates to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<h2><a href="#where-are-the-state-objects" name="where-are-the-state-objects">Where Are the State Objects?</a></h2>
<p>I did gloss over one bit here. To change states, we need to assign <code>state_</code> to
point to the new one, but where does that object come from? With our <code>enum</code>
implementation, that was a no-brainer&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;<code>enum</code> values are primitives like
numbers. But now our states are classes, which means we need an actual instance
to point to. There are two common answers to this:</p>
<h3><a href="#static-states" name="static-states">Static states</a></h3>
<p>If the state object doesn&#8217;t have any other <span name="fn">fields</span>, then
the only data it stores is a pointer to the internal virtual method table so
that its methods can be called. In that case, there&#8217;s no reason to ever have
more than one instance of it. Every instance would be identical anyway.</p>
<aside name="fn">

<p>If your state has no fields and only <em>one</em> virtual method in it, you can
simplify this pattern even more. Replace each state <em>class</em> with a state
<em>function</em>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;just a plain vanilla top-level function. Then, the <code>state_</code> field
in your main class becomes a simple function pointer.</p>
</aside>

<p>In that case, you can make a single <em>static</em> instance. Even if you have a
bunch of FSMs all going at the same time in that same state, they can all point
to the <span name="flyweight">same instance</span> since it has nothing
machine-specific about it.</p>
<aside name="flyweight">

<p>This is the <a href="flyweight.html" class="gof-pattern">Flyweight</a> pattern.</p>
</aside>

<p><em>Where</em> you put that static instance is up to you. Find a place that makes
sense. For no particular reason, let&#8217;s put ours inside the base state class:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">HeroineState</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">StandingState</span> <span class="n">standing</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">DuckingState</span> <span class="n">ducking</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">DivingState</span> <span class="n">diving</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="c1">// Other code...</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Each of those static fields is the one instance of that state that the game
uses. To make the heroine jump, the standing state would do something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">PRESS_B</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">state_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">HeroineState</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">jumping</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">setGraphics</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IMAGE_JUMP</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<h3><a href="#instantiated-states" name="instantiated-states">Instantiated states</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, though, this doesn&#8217;t fly. A static state won&#8217;t work for the ducking
state. It has a <code>chargeTime_</code> field, and that&#8217;s specific to the heroine that
happens to be ducking. This may coincidentally work in our game if there&#8217;s only
one heroine, but if we try to add two-player co-op and have two heroines on
screen at the same time, we&#8217;ll have problems.</p>
<p>In that case, we have to <span name="fragment">create</span> a state
object when we transition to it, like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c1">// In StandingState:</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">PRESS_DOWN</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">delete</span> <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">state_</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">state_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">DuckingState</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="c1">// Other code...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This lets each FSM have its own instance of the state. When I can, I prefer to
use static states since they don&#8217;t burn memory and CPU cycles allocating objects
each state change. For states that are more, uh, <em>stateful</em>, though, this is the
way to go.</p>
<aside name="fragment">

<p>When you dynamically allocate states, you may have to worry about fragmentation.

<h2><a href="#enter-and-exit-actions" name="enter-and-exit-actions">Enter and Exit Actions</a></h2>
<p>The goal of the State pattern is to encapsulate all of the behavior and data for
one state in a single class. We&#8217;ve done that pretty well, but there&#8217;s still a
loose end. We moved handling user input and updating the charge time into
<code>DuckingState</code>, but there&#8217;s a bit of ducking-specific code left outside. Over in
the standing state, when we <em>start</em> ducking, it does some initialization:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c1">// In standing state:</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">PRESS_DOWN</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Change state...</span>
  <span class="n">chargeTime_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">setGraphics</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IMAGE_DUCK</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The ducking state should take care of resetting the charge time (after
all, it&#8217;s the object that has that field) and playing the animation. We can
handle that by giving the state an <em>entry action</em>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">DuckingState</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">HeroineState</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">enter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">chargeTime_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">setGraphics</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IMAGE_DUCK</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="c1">// Other code...</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Back in <code>Heroine</code>, we wrap changing the state in a little convenience method
that calls that on the new state:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">changeState</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HeroineState</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">state</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">delete</span> <span class="n">state_</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">state_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">state</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">state_</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">enter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the standing code we use it like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">PRESS_DOWN</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">changeState</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">DuckingState</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now ducking really is encapsulated. One particularly nice thing about entry
actions is that they run when you enter the state regardless of which state
you&#8217;re coming <em>from</em>.</p>
<p>Most real-world state graphs have multiple transitions into the same state. For
example, maybe our heroine can fire her weapon while standing, ducking, and
jumping. That means you end up duplicating some code everywhere that transition
occurs. Entry actions give you a place to consolidate that.</p>
<p>We can, of course, also extend this to support an <em>exit action</em>. This is just a
method we call on the state we&#8217;re <em>leaving</em> right before we switch to the new
state.</p>
<h2><a href="#what's-the-catch" name="what's-the-catch">What&#8217;s the Catch?</a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent all this time selling you on FSMs, and now I&#8217;m going to pull the rug
out from under you. Everything I&#8217;ve said so far is true, and FSMs are a good fit
for some problems. But their greatest virtue is also their greatest flaw.</p>
<p>State machines help you untangle hairy code by enforcing a very <span
name="turing">constrained</span> structure on it. All you&#8217;ve got is a fixed set
of states, a single current state, and some hardcoded transitions.</p>
<aside name="turing">

<p>A finite state machine isn&#8217;t even <em>Turing complete</em>. Automata theory describes
computation using a series of abstract models, each more complex than the
previous. A <em>Turing machine</em> is one of the most expressive models.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turing complete&#8221; means a system (usually a programming language) is expressive
enough to implement a Turing machine in it, which means all Turing complete
languages are, in some ways, equally expressive. FSMs are not expressive enough
to be in that club.</p>
</aside>

<p>If you try using a state machine for something more complex like game AI, you
will slam face-first into the limitations of that model. Thankfully, our
forebears have found ways to dodge some of those barriers. I&#8217;ll close this
chapter out by walking you through a couple of them.</p>
<h2><a href="#concurrent-state-machines" name="concurrent-state-machines">Concurrent State Machines</a></h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve decided to give our heroine the ability to carry a gun. When she&#8217;s packing
heat, she can still do everything she could before: run, jump, duck, etc. But
she also needs to be able to fire her weapon while doing it.</p>
<p>If we want to stick to the confines of an FSM, we have to <em>double</em> the number of
states we have. For each existing state, we&#8217;ll need another one for doing the
same thing while she&#8217;s armed: standing, standing with gun, jumping, jumping with
gun, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Add a couple of more weapons and the number of states explodes combinatorially.
Not only is it a huge number of states, it&#8217;s a huge amount of redundancy: the
unarmed and armed states are almost identical except for the little bit of code
to handle firing.</p>
<p>The problem is that we&#8217;ve <span name="combination">jammed</span> two pieces of
state&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;what she&#8217;s <em>doing</em> and what she&#8217;s <em>carrying</em>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;into a single machine.
To model all possible combinations, we would need a state for each <em>pair</em>. The
fix is obvious: have two separate state machines.</p>
<aside name="combination">

<p>If we want to cram <em>n</em> states for what she&#8217;s doing and <em>m</em> states for what she&#8217;s
carrying into a single machine, we need <em>n &times; m</em> states. With two machines,
it&#8217;s just <em>n + m</em>.</p>
</aside>

<p>We keep our original state machine for what she&#8217;s doing and leave it alone. Then
we define a separate state machine for what she&#8217;s carrying. <code>Heroine</code> will have
<em>two</em> &#8220;state&#8221; references, one for each, like:</p>
<p><span name="equip-state"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Heroine</span>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="equip-state">

<p>For illustrative purposes, we&#8217;re using the full State pattern for her equipment.
In practice, since it only has two states, a Boolean flag would work too.</p>
</aside>

<p>When the heroine delegates inputs to the states, she hands it to both of them:</p>
<p><span name="consume"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">handleInput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Input</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="consume">

<p>A more full-featured system would probably have a way for one state machine to
<em>consume</em> an input so that the other doesn&#8217;t receive it. That would prevent both
machines from erroneously trying to respond to the same input.</p>
</aside>

<p>Each state machine can then respond to inputs, spawn behavior, and change its
state independently of the other machine. When the two sets of states are mostly
unrelated, this works well.</p>
<p>In practice, you&#8217;ll find a few cases where the states do interact. For example,
maybe she can&#8217;t fire while jumping, or maybe she can&#8217;t do a dive attack if she&#8217;s
armed. To handle that, in the code for one state, you&#8217;ll probably just do some
crude <code>if</code> tests on the <em>other</em> machine&#8217;s state to coordinate them. It&#8217;s not the most
elegant solution, but it gets the job done.</p>
<h2><a href="#hierarchical-state-machines" name="hierarchical-state-machines">Hierarchical State Machines</a></h2>
<p>After fleshing out our heroine&#8217;s behavior some more, she&#8217;ll likely have a bunch
of similar states. For example, she may have standing, walking, running, and
sliding states. In any of those, pressing B jumps and pressing down ducks.</p>
<p>With a simple state machine implementation, we have to duplicate that code in
each of those states. It would be better if we could implement that once and
reuse it across all of the states.</p>
<p>If this was just object-oriented code instead of a state machine, one way to
share code across those states would be using <span
name="inheritance">inheritance</span>. We could define a class for an &#8220;on
ground&#8221; state that handles jumping and ducking. Standing, walking, running, and
sliding would then inherit from that and add their own additional behavior.</p>
<aside name="inheritance">

<p>This has both good and bad implications. Inheritance is a powerful means of code
reuse, but it&#8217;s also a very strong coupling between two chunks of code. It&#8217;s a big
hammer, so swing it carefully.</p>
</aside>

<p>It turns out, this is a common structure called a <em>hierarchical state machine</em>.
A state can have a <em>superstate</em> (making itself a <em>substate</em>). When an event
comes in, if the substate doesn&#8217;t handle it, it rolls up the chain of
superstates. In other words, it works just like overriding inherited methods.</p>
<p>In fact, if we&#8217;re using the State pattern to implement our FSM, we can
use class inheritance to implement the hierarchy. Define a base class for the
superstate:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">OnGroundState</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">HeroineState</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">handleInput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Input</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">PRESS_B</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// Jump...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">PRESS_DOWN</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// Duck...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And then each substate inherits it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">DuckingState</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">OnGroundState</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">handleInput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Heroine</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Input</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">RELEASE_DOWN</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// Stand up...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// Didn&#39;t handle input, so walk up hierarchy.</span>
      <span class="n">OnGroundState</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">handleInput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">heroine</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This isn&#8217;t the only way to implement the hierarchy, of course. If you aren&#8217;t
using the Gang of Four&#8217;s State pattern, this won&#8217;t work. Instead, you can model
the current state&#8217;s chain of superstates explicitly using a <em>stack</em> of states
instead of a single state in the main class.</p>
<p>The current state is the one on the top of the stack, under that is its
immediate superstate, and then <em>that</em> state&#8217;s superstate and so on. When you
dish out some state-specific behavior, you start at the top of the stack and
walk down until one of the states handles it. (If none do, you ignore it.)</p>
<h2><a href="#pushdown-automata" name="pushdown-automata">Pushdown Automata</a></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s another common extension to finite state machines that also uses a stack
of states. Confusingly, the stack represents something entirely different, and
is used to solve a different problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that finite state machines have no concept of <em>history</em>. You know
what state you <em>are</em> in, but have no memory of what state you <em>were</em> in. There&#8217;s
no easy way to go back to a previous state.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: Earlier, we let our fearless heroine arm herself to the
teeth. When she fires her gun, we need a new state that plays the firing
animation and spawns the bullet and any visual effects. So we slap together a
<code>FiringState</code> and make <span name="shared">all of the states</span> that she can
fire from transition into that when the fire button is pressed.</p>
<aside name="shared">

<p>Since this is behavior duplicated across several states, this may also be a good
place to use a hierarchical state machine to reuse that code.</p>
</aside>

<p>The tricky part is what state she transitions to <em>after</em> firing. She can pop off
a round while standing, running, jumping, and ducking. When the firing sequence
is complete, she should transition back to what she was doing before.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re sticking with a vanilla FSM, we&#8217;ve already forgotten what state she was
in. To keep track of it, we&#8217;d have to define a slew of nearly identical states
&#8212; firing while standing, firing while running, firing while jumping, and so on
&#8212; just so that each one can have a hardcoded transition that goes back to the
right state when it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;d really like is a way to <em>store</em> the state she was in before firing and
then <em>recall</em> it later. Again, automata theory is here to help. The relevant
data structure is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton"><em>pushdown
automaton</em></a>.</p>
<p>Where a finite state machine has a <em>single</em> pointer to a state, a pushdown
automaton has a <em>stack</em> of them. In an FSM, transitioning to a new state
<em>replaces</em> the previous one. A pushdown automaton lets you do that, but it also
gives you two additional operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can <em>push</em> a new state onto the stack. The &#8220;current&#8221; state is always the
    one on top of the stack, so this transitions to the new state. But it leaves
    the previous state directly under it on the stack instead of discarding it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can <em>pop</em> the topmost state off the stack. That state is discarded, and
    the state under it becomes the new current state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/state-pushdown.png" /></p>
<p>This is just what we need for firing. We create a <em>single</em> firing state. When
the fire button is pressed while in any other state, we <em>push</em> the firing state
onto the stack. When the firing animation is done, we <em>pop</em> that state off, and
the pushdown automaton automatically transitions us right back to the state we
were in before.</p>
<h2><a href="#so-how-useful-are-they" name="so-how-useful-are-they">So How Useful Are They?</a></h2>
<p>Even with those common extensions to state machines, they are still pretty
limited. The trend these days in game AI is more toward exciting things like
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140402204854/http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2011/02/24/introduction-to-behavior-trees/">behavior trees</a> and <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html">planning systems</a>. If AI is what you&#8217;re interested in,
all this chapter has done is whet your appetite. You&#8217;ll want to read other books
to satisfy it.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean finite state machines, pushdown automata, and other simple
systems aren&#8217;t useful. They&#8217;re a good modeling tool for certain kinds of
problems. Finite state machines are useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have an entity whose behavior changes based on some internal state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That state can be rigidly divided into one of a relatively small number of
    distinct options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entity responds to a series of inputs or events over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In games, they are most known for being used in AI, but they are also common in
implementations of user input handling, navigating menu screens, parsing text,
network protocols, and other asynchronous behavior.</p>
