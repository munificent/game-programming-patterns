<p><em>Give behavior the flexibility of data by encoding it as instructions for a
virtual machine.</em></p>
<h2><a href="#motivation" name="motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Making games may be fun, but it certainly ain&#8217;t easy. Modern games require <span
name="sprawling">enormous</span>, complex codebases. Console manufacturers and
app marketplace gatekeepers have stringent quality requirements, and a single
crash bug can prevent your game from shipping.</p>
<aside name="sprawling">

<p>I worked on a game that had six million lines of C++ code. For comparison, the
software controlling the Mars Curiosity rover is less than half that.</p>
</aside>

<p>At the same time, we&#8217;re expected to squeeze every drop of performance out of the
platform. Games push hardware like nothing else, and we have to optimize
relentlessly just to keep pace with the competition.</p>
<p>To handle these high stability and performance requirements, we reach for
heavyweight languages like C++ that have both low-level expressiveness to make
the most of the hardware, and rich type systems to prevent or at least corral
bugs.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on our skill at this, but it has its cost. Being a proficient
programmer takes years of dedicated training, after which you must contend with
the sheer scale of your codebase. Build times for large games can vary somewhere
between &#8220;go get a coffee&#8221; and &#8220;go roast your own beans, hand-grind them, pull an
espresso, foam some milk and practice your latte art in the froth&#8221;.</p>
<p>On top of these challenges, games have one more nasty constraint: <em>fun</em>. Players
demand a play experience that&#8217;s both novel and yet carefully balanced. That
requires constant iteration, but if every tweak requires bugging an engineer to
muck around in piles of low-level code and then waiting for a glacial recompile,
you&#8217;ve killed your creative flow.</p>
<h3><a href="#spell-fight" name="spell-fight">Spell fight!</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re working on a magic-based fighting game. A pair of wizards square
off and fling enchantments at each other until a victor is pronounced. We could
define these spells in code, but that means an engineer has to be involved every
time one is modified. When a designer wants to tweak a few numbers and get a
feel for them, they have to recompile the entire game, reboot it, and get back
into a fight.</p>
<p>Like most games these days, we also need to be able to update it after it ships,
both to fix bugs and to add new content. If all of these spells are hard-coded,
then updating them means patching the actual game executable.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take things a bit farther and say that we also want to support <em>modding</em>.
We want <em>users</em> to be able to create their own spells. If those are in code,
that means every modder needs a full compiler toolchain to build the game, and
we have to release the sources. Worse, if they have a bug in their spell, it can
crash the game on some other player&#8217;s machine.</p>
<h3><a href="#data-&gt;-code" name="data-&gt;-code">Data &gt; code</a></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that our engine&#8217;s implementation language isn&#8217;t the right fit.
We need spells to be safely sandboxed from the core game. We want them to be
easy to modify and reload, and physically separate from the rest of the
executable.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but to me that sounds a lot like <em>data</em>. If we could
define our behavior in separate data files that the game engine loads and
&#8220;executes&#8221; in some way, we can achieve all of our goals.</p>
<p>We just need to figure out what &#8220;execute&#8221; means for data. How do you make some
bytes in a file express behavior? There are a few ways to do this. I think it
will help you get a picture of <em>this</em> pattern&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses if we
compare it to another one: the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern"
class="gof-pattern">Interpreter</a> pattern.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-interpreter-pattern" name="the-interpreter-pattern">The Interpreter pattern</a></h3>
<p>I could write a whole chapter on this pattern, but four other guys already
covered that for me. Instead, I&#8217;ll cram the briefest of introductions in here.
It starts with a language&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;think <em>programming</em> language&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that you want to
execute. Say, for example, it supports arithmetic expressions like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then you take each piece of that expression, each rule in the language&#8217;s
grammar, and turn it into an <em>object</em>. The number literals will be objects:</p>
<p><img src="images/bytecode-numbers.png" /></p>
<p>Basically just little wrappers around the raw value. The operators will be
objects too, and they&#8217;ll have references to their operands. If you take into
account the parentheses and precedence, that expression <span
name="magic">magically</span> turns into a little tree of objects like so:</p>
<p><img src="images/bytecode-ast.png" /></p>
<aside name="magic">

<p>What &#8220;magic&#8221; is this? It&#8217;s simple: <em>parsing</em>. A parser takes a string of
characters and turns it into an <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, a collection of objects
representing the grammatical structure of the text.</p>
<p>Whip up one of these and you&#8217;ve got yourself half of a compiler.</p>
</aside>

<p>The interpreter pattern isn&#8217;t about <em>creating</em> that tree, it&#8217;s about <em>executing</em>
it. The way it works is pretty clever. Each object in the tree is an expression,
or a subexpression. In true object-oriented fashion, we&#8217;ll let expressions
evaluate themselves.</p>
<p>First, we define a base interface that all expressions implement:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Expression</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">Expression</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">evaluate</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then we define a class that implements that for each kind of expression in our
language&#8217;s grammar. The simplest one is numbers:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">NumberExpression</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Expression</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="n">NumberExpression</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">evaluate</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A literal number expression just evaluates to its value. Addition and
multiplication are a bit more complex because they contain subexpressions.
Before they can evaluate themselves, they need to recursively evaluate those
first. Like so:</p>
<p><span name="addition"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AdditionExpression</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Expression</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="n">AdditionExpression</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Expression</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">left</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Expression</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">left_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">right_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">right</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">evaluate</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Evaluate the operands.</span>
    <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">left</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">left_</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">evaluate</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">right</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">right_</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">evaluate</span><span class="p">();</span>

    <span class="c1">// Add them.</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">left</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="n">Expression</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">left_</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">Expression</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">right_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="addition">

<p>I&#8217;m sure you can figure out what the implementation of multiply looks like.</p>
</aside>

<p>Pretty neat right? Just a couple of simple classes and now we can represent and
evaluate arbitrarily complex arithmetic expressions. We just need to create the
right objects and wire them up correctly.</p>
<aside name="ruby">

<p>Ruby was implemented like this for something like 15 years. At version 1.9, they
switched to bytecode like this chapter describes. Look how much time I&#8217;m saving
you!</p>
</aside>

<p>It&#8217;s a <span name="ruby">beautiful</span>, simple pattern, but is has some
problems. Look up at the illustration. What do you see? Lots of little boxes,
and lots of arrows between them. Code is represented as a sprawling fractal tree
of tiny objects. That has some unpleasant consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Loading it from disk requires instantiating and wiring up tons of these
    small objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those objects and the pointers between them use a lot of <span
    name="vtable">memory</span>. On a 32-bit machine that little arithmetic
    expression up there takes up at least 68 bytes, not including padding.</p>
<aside name="vtable">

<p>If you&#8217;re playing along at home, don&#8217;t forget to take into account the
vtable pointers.</p>
</aside>

</li>
<li>
<p>Traversing the pointers into subexpressions is murder on your <span
    name="cache">data cache</span>. Meanwhile, all of those virtual method calls
    wreak carnage on your instruction cache.</p>
<aside name="cache">

<p>See the chapter on <a href="data-locality.html" class="pattern">Data
Locality</a> for more on what the cache is and how it affects your
performance.</p>
</aside>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Put those together, and what do they spell? S-L-O-W. There&#8217;s a reason most
programming languages in wide use aren&#8217;t based on the Interpreter pattern. It&#8217;s
just too slow, and uses up too much memory.</p>
<h3><a href="#machine-code,-virtually" name="machine-code,-virtually">Machine code, virtually</a></h3>
<p>Consider our game. When we run it, the player&#8217;s computer doesn&#8217;t traverse a
bunch of C++ grammar tree structures at runtime. Instead, we compile it ahead of
time to machine code and the CPU runs that. What&#8217;s machine code got going for
it?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s dense.</em> It&#8217;s a solid, contiguous blob of binary data, and no bit goes
    to waste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s linear.</em> Instructions are packed together and executed one right after
    another. No jumping around in memory (unless you&#8217;re doing actual control
    flow, of course).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s low-level.</em> Each instruction does one relatively minimal thing, and
    interesting behavior comes from <em>composing</em> them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s fast.</em> As a consequence of all of these (well, and the fact that it&#8217;s
    implemented directly in hardware), machine code runs like the wind.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds swell, but we don&#8217;t want actual machine code for our spells. Letting
users provide machine code which our game executes is just begging for <span
name="jit">security problems</span>. What we need is a compromise between the
performance of machine code and the safety of the Interpreter pattern.</p>
<p>What if instead of loading actual machine code and executing it directly, we
defined our own <em>virtual</em> machine code? We&#8217;d then write a little emulator for it
in our game. It would be similar to machine code&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;dense, linear, relatively
low-level&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but would also be handled entirely by our game so we could safely
sandbox it.</p>
<aside name="jit">

<p>This is why many game consoles and iOS don&#8217;t allow programs to execute machine
code loaded or generated at runtime. That&#8217;s a drag because the fastest
programming language implementations do exactly that. They contain a
&#8220;just-in-time&#8221; compiler, or <em>JIT</em>, that translates the language to optimized
machine code on the fly.</p>
</aside>

<p>We&#8217;d call our little emulator a <span name="virtual"><em>virtual machine</em></span>
(or &#8220;VM&#8221; for short), and the synthetic binary machine code it runs <em>bytecode</em>.
It&#8217;s got the flexibility and ease of use of defining things in data, but better
performance than higher-level representations like the Interpreter pattern.</p>
<aside name="virtual">

<p>In programming language circles, &#8220;virtual machine&#8221; and &#8220;interpreter&#8221; are
synonymous, and I use them interchangeably here. When I refer to the Gang of
Four&#8217;s Interpreter pattern, I&#8217;ll use &#8220;pattern&#8221; to make it clear.</p>
</aside>

<p>This sounds daunting, though. My goal for the rest of this chapter is to show
you that if you keep your feature list pared down, it&#8217;s actually pretty
approachable. Even if you end up not using this pattern yourself, you&#8217;ll at
least have a better understanding of Lua and many other languages which are
implemented using it.</p>
<h2><a href="#the-pattern" name="the-pattern">The Pattern</a></h2>
<p>An <strong>instruction set</strong> defines the low-level operations that can be performed.
These are encoded as a <strong>sequence of bytes</strong>. A <strong>virtual machine</strong> executes
these instructions one at a time, using a <strong>stack for intermediate values</strong>. By
combining instructions, complex high-level behavior can be defined.</p>
<h2><a href="#when-to-use-it" name="when-to-use-it">When to Use It</a></h2>
<p>This is the most complex pattern in this book, and not something to throw into
your game lightly. Use it when you have a lot of behavior you need to define and
your game&#8217;s implementation language isn&#8217;t a good fit because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s too low-level, making it tedious or error-prone to program in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterating on it takes too long due to slow compile times or other tooling
    issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has too much trust. If you want to ensure the behavior being defined
    can&#8217;t break the game, you need to sandbox it from the rest of the codebase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, that list describes a bunch of your game. Who doesn&#8217;t want a faster
iteration loop or more safety? However, that doesn&#8217;t come free. Bytecode is
slower than native code, so it isn&#8217;t a good fit for performance-critical parts
of your engine.</p>
<h2><a href="#keep-in-mind" name="keep-in-mind">Keep in Mind</a></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s something <span name="seductive">seductive</span> about creating your
own language or system-within-a-system. I&#8217;ll be doing a minimal example here,
but in the real world, these things tend to grow like vines.</p>
<aside name="seductive">

<p>For me, game development is seductive in the same way. In both cases, I&#8217;m
striving to create a virtual space for others to play and be creative in.</p>
</aside>

<p>Every time I see someone define a little language or a scripting system, they
say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it will be tiny.&#8221; Then, inevitably, they add more and more
little features until it&#8217;s a full-fledged <span name="template">language</span>.
Except, unlike some other languages, it grew in an ad-hoc, organic fashion and
has all of the architectural elegance of a shanty town.</p>
<aside name="template">

<p>For example, see every templating language ever.</p>
</aside>

<p>Of course, there&#8217;s nothing <em>wrong</em> with making a full-fledged language. Just
make sure you do so deliberately. Otherwise, be very careful to control the
scope of what your bytecode can express. Put a short leash on it before it runs
away from you.</p>
<h3><a href="#you'll-need-a-front-end" name="you'll-need-a-front-end">You&#8217;ll need a front-end</a></h3>
<p>Low-level bytecode instructions are great for performance, but a binary bytecode
format is <em>not</em> what your users are going to author. One reason we&#8217;re moving
behavior out of code is so that we can express it at a <em>higher</em> level. If C++ is
too low level, making your users effectively write in <span
name="assembly">assembly language</span>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;even one of your own design&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;isn&#8217;t
an improvement!</p>
<aside name="assembly">

<p>Challenging that assertion is the venerable game
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboWar">RoboWar</a>. In that game, <em>players</em> write
little programs to control a robot in a language very similar to assembly and
the kind of instruction sets we&#8217;ll be discussing here.</p>
<p>It was my first introduction to assembly-like languages.</p>
</aside>

<p>Much like the Gang of Four&#8217;s Interpreter pattern, it&#8217;s assumed that you also
have some way to <em>generate</em> the bytecode. Usually, users author their behavior
in some higher level format and a tool translates that to the bytecode that our
virtual machine understands. In other words, a compiler.</p>
<p>I know, that sounds scary. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m mentioning it here. If you don&#8217;t have
the resources to build an authoring tool, then bytecode isn&#8217;t for you. But, as
we&#8217;ll see later, it may not be as bad as you think.</p>
<h3><a href="#you'll-miss-your-debugger" name="you'll-miss-your-debugger">You&#8217;ll miss your debugger</a></h3>
<p>Programming is hard. We know what we want the machine to do, but we don&#8217;t always
communicate that correctly&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;we write bugs. To help find and fix those, we&#8217;ve
amassed a pile of tools to understand what our code is doing wrong, and how to
right it.</p>
<p>We have debuggers, static analyzers, decompilers, etc. All of those tools are
designed to work with some existing language: either machine code or something
higher level.</p>
<p>When you define your own bytecode VM, you leave those tools behind. Sure, you
can step through the VM in your debugger, but that tells you what the VM
<em>itself</em> is doing, and not what the bytecode it&#8217;s interpreting is up to. It
certainly doesn&#8217;t help you map that bytecode back to the high-level form it was
compiled from.</p>
<p>If the behavior you&#8217;re defining is simple, you can scrape by without too much
tooling to help you debug it. But as the scale of your content grows, plan to
invest real time into features that help users see what their bytecode is doing.
Those features might not <span name="debugger">ship</span> in your game, but
they&#8217;ll be critical to ensure that you actually <em>can</em> ship your game.</p>
<aside name="debugger">

<p>Of course, if you want your game to be moddable, then you <em>will</em> ship those
features, and they&#8217;ll be even more important.</p>
</aside>

<h2><a href="#sample-code" name="sample-code">Sample Code</a></h2>
<p>After the previous couple of sections, you might be surprised how
straightforward the implementation is. First, we need to craft an instruction
set for our VM. Before we start thinking about bytecode and stuff, let&#8217;s just
think about it like an API.</p>
<h3><a href="#a-magical-api" name="a-magical-api">A magical API</a></h3>
<p>If we were defining spells in straight C++ code, what kind of API would we need
for that code to call into? What are the basic operations in the game engine
that spells are defined in terms of?</p>
<p>Most spells ultimately change one of the stats of a wizard, so we&#8217;ll start with
a couple for that:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setHealth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">wizard</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setWisdom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">wizard</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setAgility</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">wizard</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first parameter identifies which wizard is affected, say <code>0</code> for the
player&#8217;s and <code>1</code> for their opponent. This way, healing spells can affect the
player&#8217;s own wizard, while damaging attacks harm their nemesis. These three
little methods cover a surprisingly wide variety of magical effects.</p>
<p>If the spells just silently tweaked stats, the game logic would be fine, but
playing it would bore players to tears. Let&#8217;s fix that:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">playSound</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">soundId</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">spawnParticles</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">particleType</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>These don&#8217;t affect gameplay, but they crank up the intensity of the gameplay
<em>experience</em>. We could add more for camera shake, animation, etc., but this is
enough to get us started.</p>
<h3><a href="#a-magical-instruction-set" name="a-magical-instruction-set">A magical instruction set</a></h3>
<p>Now let&#8217;s see how we&#8217;d turn this <em>programmatic</em> API into something that can be
controlled from data. Let&#8217;s start small and then we&#8217;ll work our way up to the
whole shebang. For now, we&#8217;ll ditch all of the parameters to these methods.
We&#8217;ll say the <code>set___()</code> methods always affect the player&#8217;s own wizard and
always max out the stat. Likewise, the FX operations always play a single
hard-coded sound and particle effect.</p>
<p>Given that, a spell is just a series of instructions. Each one identifies which
operation you want to perform. We can enumerate them:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Instruction</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">INST_SET_HEALTH</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x00</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">INST_SET_WISDOM</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x01</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">INST_SET_AGILITY</span>     <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x02</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">INST_PLAY_SOUND</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x03</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">INST_SPAWN_PARTICLES</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x04</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To encode a spell in data, we just store an array of enum values. We&#8217;ve only got
a few different primitives, so the range of enum values easily fits into a byte.
This means a spell is just a list of <span name="byte">bytes</span>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;ergo
&#8220;bytecode&#8221;.</p>
<p><img src="images/bytecode-code.png" /></p>
<aside name="byte">

<p>Some bytecode VMs use more than a single byte for each instruction and have more
complicated rules for how they are decoded. Actual machine code on common chips
like x86 is a good bit more complex.</p>
<p>But a single byte is good enough for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual
Machine</a> and Microsoft&#8217;s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">Common Language Runtime</a>
which forms the backbone of the .NET platform, and it&#8217;s good enough for us.</p>
</aside>

<p>To execute a single instruction, we see which primitive it is and dispatch to
the right API method:</p>

<p>In this way, our interpreter forms the bridge between code world and data world.

<p>Type that in and you&#8217;ll have written your first virtual machine. Unfortunately,
it&#8217;s not very flexible. We can&#8217;t define a spell that touches the player&#8217;s
opponent, or lowers a stat. We can only play one sound!</p>
<p>To get something that starts to have the expressive feel of an actual language,
we need to get parameters in here.</p>
<h3><a href="#a-stack-machine" name="a-stack-machine">A stack machine</a></h3>
<p>To execute a complex nested expression, you start with the innermost
subexpressions. You calculate those and the results flow outward as arguments to
the expressions that contain them until eventually the whole expression has been
evaluated.</p>
<p>The Interpreter pattern models this explicitly as a tree of nested objects, but
we want the speed of a flat list of instructions. We still need to ensure
results from subexpressions flow to the right surrounding expressions. But,
since our data is flattened, we&#8217;ll have to use the <em>order</em> of the instructions
to control that. We&#8217;ll do it the same way your CPU does: <span

<p>The VM maintains an internal stack of values. In our example, the only kinds of
values our instructions work with are numbers, so we can just use a simple array
of ints. Whenever a bit of data needs to work its way from one instruction to
another, it gets there through the stack.</p>
<p>Like the name implies, values can be pushed onto or popped off of the stack, so
let&#8217;s add a couple of methods for that:</p>

<p>When an instruction needs to receive parameters, it pops them off the stack like

<p>To get some values <em>onto</em> that stack, we need one more instruction: a literal.
It represents a raw integer value. But where does <em>it</em> get its value from? How
do we avoid some turtles-all-the-way-down infinite regress here?</p>
<p>The trick is to take advantage of the fact that our instruction stream is just a
sequence of bytes: we can stuff the number directly in the instruction stream.
We define another instruction type for a number literal like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">INST_LITERAL</span>:
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Read the next byte from the bytecode.</span>

</pre></div>


<aside name="single">

<p>Here, I&#8217;m just reading a single byte for the value to avoid the fiddly code
required to decode a multiple-byte integer, but in a real implementation, you&#8217;d
want to be able to have literals that cover your full numeric range.</p>
</aside>

<p><img src="images/bytecode-literal.png" /></p>
<p>It reads the next <span name="single">byte</span> in the bytecode stream <em>as a
number</em>, and pushes it onto the stack.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s string a few of these instructions together and watch the interpreter
execute them to get a feel for how the stack works. We start with an empty stack
and the interpreter pointing to the first instruction:</p>
<p><img src="images/bytecode-stack-1.png" /></p>
<p>First, it executes the first <code>INST_LITERAL</code>. That reads the next byte from the
bytecode (<code>0</code>) and pushes it onto the stack:</p>
<p><img src="images/bytecode-stack-2.png" /></p>
<p>Then it executes the second <code>INST_LITERAL</code>. That reads the <code>10</code> and pushes it:</p>
<p><img src="images/bytecode-stack-3.png" /></p>
<p>Finally, it executes <code>INST_SET_HEALTH</code>. That pops <code>10</code> and stores it in
<code>amount</code>, then pops <code>0</code> and stores it in <code>wizard</code>. Then it calls <code>setHealth()</code>
with those parameters.</p>
<p>Ta-da! We&#8217;ve got a spell that sets the player&#8217;s wizard&#8217;s health to ten points.
Now we&#8217;ve got enough flexibility to define spells that set either wizard&#8217;s stats
to whatever amounts we want. We can also play different sounds and spawn
particles.</p>
<p>But&#8230; this still just feels like a <em>data</em> format. We can&#8217;t, for example, raise
a wizard&#8217;s health by half of their wisdom. Our designers want to be able to
express <em>rules</em> for spells, not just <em>values</em>.</p>
<h3><a href="#behavior-=-composition" name="behavior-=-composition">Behavior = composition</a></h3>
<p>If we think of our little VM like a programming language, all it supports now is
a couple of built-in functions and constant parameters for them. To get bytecode
to feel like <em>behavior</em>, what we&#8217;re missing is <em>composition</em>.</p>
<p>Our designers need to be able to create expressions that combine different
values in interesting ways. For a simple example, they want spells that modify a
stat <em>by</em> a certain amount instead of <em>to</em> a certain amount.</p>
<p>That requires taking into account a stat&#8217;s current value. We have instructions
for <em>writing</em> a stat, we just need to add a couple to <em>read</em> stats:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">INST_GET_HEALTH</span>:
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">wizard</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pop</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">getHealth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">wizard</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">INST_GET_WISDOM</span>:
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">INST_GET_AGILITY</span>:
  <span class="c1">// You get the idea...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, these work with the stack in both directions. They pop a
parameter to determine which wizard to get the stat for, then look up the stat&#8217;s
value and push that back onto the stack.</p>
<p>This lets us write spells that copy stats around. We could create a spell that
set a wizard&#8217;s agility to their wisdom, or a strange incantation that set one
wizard&#8217;s health to mirror his opponent&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Better, but still quite limited. Next we need arithmetic. It&#8217;s time our baby VM
learned how to add 1 + 1. We&#8217;ll add a few more instructions. By now, you&#8217;ve
probably got the hang of it and can guess how they look. I&#8217;ll just show
addition:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">INST_ADD</span>:
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pop</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pop</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Like our other instructions, it pops a couple of values, does a bit of work, and
then pushes the result back. Up until now, every new instruction gave us an
incremental improvement in expressiveness, but we just made a big leap. It isn&#8217;t
obvious, but we can now handle all sorts of complicated, deeply nested
arithmetic expressions.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through a slightly more complex example. Say we want a spell that
increases the player&#8217;s wizard&#8217;s health by the average of their agility and
wisdom. In code, that&#8217;s:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">setHealth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">getHealth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">getAgility</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">getWisdom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might think we&#8217;d need instructions to handle the explicit grouping that
parentheses give you in the expression here, but the stack supports that
implicitly. Here&#8217;s how you could evaluate this by hand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the wizard&#8217;s current health and remember it.</li>
<li>Get the wizard&#8217;s agility and remember it.</li>
<li>Do the same for their wisdom.</li>
<li>Get those last two and add them, and remember the result.</li>
<li>Divide that by two and remember the result.</li>
<li>Recall the wizard&#8217;s health and add it to that result.</li>
<li>Take that result and set the wizard&#8217;s health to that value.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you see all of those &#8220;remembers&#8221; and &#8220;recalls&#8221;? Each &#8220;remember&#8221; corresponds
to a push, and the &#8220;recalls&#8221; are pops. That means we can translate this to
bytecode pretty easily. For example, the first line to get the wizard&#8217;s current
health is:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>LITERAL 0
GET_HEALTH
</pre></div>


<p>This bit of bytecode pushes the wizard&#8217;s health onto the stack. If we
mechanically translate each line like that, we end up with a chunk of bytecode
that evaluates our original expression. To give you a feel for how the
instructions compose, I&#8217;ve done that below.</p>
<p>To show how the stack changes over time, we&#8217;ll walk through a sample execution
where the wizard&#8217;s current stats are 45 health, 7 agility, and 11 wisdom. Next
to each instruction is what the stack looks like after executing it and then a
little comment explaining the instruction&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>LITERAL 0    [0]            # Wizard index
LITERAL 0    [0, 0]         # Wizard index
GET_HEALTH   [0, 45]        # getHealth()
LITERAL 0    [0, 45, 0]     # Wizard index
GET_AGILITY  [0, 45, 7]     # getAgility()
LITERAL 0    [0, 45, 7, 0]  # Wizard index
GET_WISDOM   [0, 45, 7, 11] # getWisdom()
ADD          [0, 45, 18]    # Add agility and wisdom
LITERAL 2    [0, 45, 18, 2] # Divisor
DIVIDE       [0, 45, 9]     # Average agility and wisdom
ADD          [0, 54]        # Add average to current health
SET_HEALTH   []             # Set health to result
</pre></div>


<p>If you watch the stack at each step, you can see how data flows through it
almost like <span name="threshold">magic</span>. We push a <code>0</code> for the wizard
index at the beginning and it just hangs around at the bottom of the stack until
we finally need it for the last <code>SET_HEALTH</code> at the end.</p>
<aside name="threshold">

<p>Maybe my threshold for &#8220;magic&#8221; is a little too low here.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#a-virtual-machine" name="a-virtual-machine">A virtual machine</a></h3>
<p>I could keep going, adding more and more instructions, but this is a good place
to stop. As it is, we&#8217;ve got a nice little VM that lets us define fairly
open-ended behavior using a simple, compact data format. While &#8220;bytecode&#8221; and
&#8220;virtual machines&#8221; sound intimidating, you can see they&#8217;re often as simple as a
stack, a loop, and a switch statement.</p>
<p>Remember our original goal to have behavior be nicely sandboxed? Now that you&#8217;ve
seen exactly how the VM is implemented, it&#8217;s obvious that we&#8217;ve accomplished
that. The bytecode can&#8217;t do anything malicious or reach out into weird parts of
the game engine because we&#8217;ve only defined a few instructions that touch the
rest of the game.</p>
<p>We control how much memory it uses by how big of a stack we create, and we&#8217;re
careful to make sure it can&#8217;t overflow that. We can even <span
name="looping">control how much <em>time</em></span> it uses. In our instruction loop,
we can track how many we&#8217;ve executed and bail out if it goes over some limit.</p>
<aside name="looping">

<p>Controlling execution time isn&#8217;t necessary in our sample because we don&#8217;t have
any instructions for looping. We could limit execution time just by limiting the
total size of the bytecode. This also means our bytecode isn&#8217;t Turing-complete.</p>
</aside>

<p>There&#8217;s just one problem left: actually creating the bytecode. So far, we&#8217;ve
taken bits of pseudocode and compiled them to bytecode by hand. Unless you&#8217;ve
got a <em>lot</em> of free time, that&#8217;s not going to work in practice.</p>
<h3><a href="#spellcasting-tools" name="spellcasting-tools">Spellcasting tools</a></h3>
<p>One of our initial goals was to have a <em>higher</em>-level way to author behavior,
but we&#8217;ve gone and created something <em>lower</em>-level than C++. It has the runtime
performance and safety we want, but absolutely none of the designer-friendly
usability.</p>
<p>To fill that gap, we need some tooling. We need a program that lets users define
the high-level behavior of a spell, then takes that and generates the
appropriate low-level stack machine bytecode.</p>
<p>That probably sounds way harder than making the VM. Many programmers were
dragged through a compilers class in college and took away from it nothing but
PTSD triggered by the sight of a <span name="dragon">book</span> with a dragon

<p>On the contrary, I encourage you to consider building a graphical interface to
let users define their behavior, especially if the people using it won&#8217;t be
highly technical. Writing text that&#8217;s free of syntax errors is difficult for
people who haven&#8217;t spent years getting used to a compiler yelling at them.</p>
<p>Instead, you can build an app that lets users &#8220;script&#8221; by clicking and dragging
little boxes or pulling down menu items, or whatever else makes sense for the
kind of behavior you want them to create.</p>

<p>The scripting system I wrote for <a href="ht
tp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hatsworth_in_the_Puzzling_Adventure">Henry Hatsworth and the Puzzling Adventure</a> worked
like this.</p>
</aside>

<p>The nice thing about this is that your UI can make it impossible for users to
create <span name="errors">&#8220;invalid&#8221;</span> programs. Instead of vomiting error
messages on them, you can just proactively disable buttons or provide default
values to ensure that the thing they&#8217;ve created is valid at all points in time.</p>
<aside name="errors">

<p>I want to stress how important error-handling is. As programmers, we tend to
view human error as a shameful personality flaw that we strive to eliminate in
ourselves.</p>
<p>To make a system that users enjoy, you have to embrace their humanity,
<em>including their fallibility</em>. Making mistakes is what people do, and is a
fundamental part of the creative process. Handling them gracefully with features
like undo helps your users be more creative and create better work.</p>
</aside>

<p>This spares you from designing a grammar and writing a parser for a little
language. But, I know, some of you find UI programming equally unpleasant. Well,
in that case, I don&#8217;t have any good news for you.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this pattern is about expressing behavior in a user-friendly,
high-level way. You have to craft the user experience. To execute the behavior
efficiently, you then need to translate that into a lower-level form. It is real
work, but if you&#8217;re up to the challenge, it can pay off.</p>

<h3><a href="#how-do-instructions-access-the-stack" name="how-do-instructions-access-the-stack">How do instructions access the stack?</a></h3>
<p>Bytecode VMs come in two main flavors: stack-based and register-based. In a
stack-based VM, instructions always work from the top of the stack, like our
sample code. For example, <code>INST_ADD</code> pops two values, adds them, and pushes the
result.</p>
<p>Register-based VMs still have a stack. The only difference is that instructions
can read their inputs from deeper in it. Instead of <code>INST_ADD</code> always <em>popping</em>
its operands, it has two indexes stored in the bytecode that identify where in
the stack to read the operands from.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>With a stack-based VM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Instructions are small.</em> Since each instruction implicitly finds its
    arguments on top of the stack, you don&#8217;t need to encode any data for
    that. This means each instruction can be pretty small, usually a single
    byte.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Code generation is simpler.</em> When you get around to writing the
    compiler or tool that outputs bytecode, you&#8217;ll find it simpler to
    generate stack-based bytecode. Since each instruction implicitly works
    from the top of the stack, you just need to output instructions in the
    right order to pass parameters between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You have more instructions.</em> Each instruction only sees the very top of
    the stack. This means that to generate code for something like <code>a = b +
    c</code>, you need separate instructions to move <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> to the top of the
    stack, perform the operation, then move the result into <code>a</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>With a register-based VM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Instructions are larger.</em> Since instructions need arguments for stack
    offsets, a single instruction needs more bits. For example, an
    instruction in <span name="lua">Lua</span>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;probably the most
    well-known register-based VM&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;is a full 32-bits. It uses 6 bits for
    the instruction type, and the rest are arguments.</p>
<aside name="lua">

<p>Lua doesn&#8217;t specify their bytecode format and it changes from version to
version. What I&#8217;m describing here is true as of Lua 5.1. For an
absolutely amazing deep dive into Lua&#8217;s internals, read <a href="http://lu
aforge.net/docman/83/98/ANoFrillsIntroToLua51VMInstructions.pdf">this</a>.</p>
</aside>

</li>
<li>
<p><em>You have fewer instructions.</em> Since each instruction can do more work,
    you don&#8217;t need as many of them. Some say you get a performance
    improvement since you don&#8217;t have to shuffle values around in the stack
    as much.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So which should you do? My recommendation is to stick with a stack-based VM.
They&#8217;re simpler to implement, and much simpler to generate code for.
Register-based VMs got a reputation for being a bit faster after Lua converted
to that style, but it depends <em>deeply</em> on your actual instructions and lots of
other details of your VM.</p>
<h3><a href="#what-instructions-do-you-have" name="what-instructions-do-you-have">What instructions do you have?</a></h3>
<p>Your instruction set defines the boundaries of what can and cannot be expressed
in bytecode, and also has a big impact on the performance of your VM. Here&#8217;s a
laundry list of the different kinds of instructions you may want:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>External primitives.</strong> These are the ones that reach out of the VM into
    the rest of the game engine and do stuff that the user can see. They control
    what kinds of real behavior can be expressed in bytecode. Without these,
    your VM can&#8217;t do anything more than burn CPU cycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal primitives.</strong> These manipulate values inside the VM&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;things
    like literals, arithmetic, comparison operators and instructions that juggle
    the stack around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control flow.</strong> Our example didn&#8217;t cover these, but when you want behavior
    that&#8217;s imperative and conditionally executes instructions or loops and
    executes instructions more than once, you need control flow. In the
    low-level language of bytecode, they&#8217;re surprisingly simple: jumps.</p>
<p>In our instruction loop, we had an index to track where we were in the
bytecode. All a jump instruction does is modify that variable and change
where we&#8217;re currently executing. In other words, it&#8217;s a <code>goto</code>. You can
build all kinds of higher-level control flow using that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstraction.</strong> If your users start defining a <em>lot</em> of stuff in data,
    eventually they&#8217;ll want to start reusing bits of bytecode instead of having
    to copy and paste it. You may want something like callable procedures.</p>
<p>In its simplest form these aren&#8217;t much more complex than a jump. The only
difference is that the VM maintains a second <em>return</em> stack. When it
executes a &#8220;call&#8221; instruction, it pushes the current instruction index onto
the return stack then jumps to the called bytecode. When it hits a &#8220;return&#8221;,
the VM pops the index from the return stack and jumps back to it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#how-are-values-represented" name="how-are-values-represented">How are values represented?</a></h3>
<p>Our sample VM only works with one kind of value, integers. That makes it easy:
the stack is just a stack of ints. A more full-featured VM will support
different data types: strings, objects, lists, etc. You&#8217;ll have to decide how
those are stored internally.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A single datatype:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s simple.</em> You don&#8217;t have to worry about tagging, conversions, or
    type-checking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You can&#8217;t work with different data types.</em> The obvious downside.
    Cramming different types into a single representation&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;think storing
    numbers as strings&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;is asking for pain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A tagged variant:</strong></p>
<p>This is the common representation for dynamically-typed languages. Every
value has two pieces. The first is a type tag&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;an enum&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that identifies
what data type is being stored. The rest of the bits are then interpreted
appropriately according to that type, like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">ValueType</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">TYPE_INT</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">TYPE_DOUBLE</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">TYPE_STRING</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Value</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">ValueType</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">union</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span>    <span class="n">intValue</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">doubleValue</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span>  <span class="n">stringValue</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Values know their type.</em> The nice thing about this representation is
    that you can check the type of a value at runtime. That&#8217;s important for
    dynamic dispatch and ensuring you don&#8217;t try to perform operations on
    types that don&#8217;t support it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It takes more memory.</em> Every value has to carry around a few extra bits
    with it to identify its type. In something as low-level as a VM, a few
    bits here and there add up quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An untagged union:</strong></p>
<p>This uses a union like the previous form, but does <em>not</em> have a type tag
that goes along with it. You have a little blob of bits that could represent
more than one type, and it&#8217;s up to you to ensure you don&#8217;t misinterpret
them.</p>
<p>This is how <span name="untyped">statically-typed</span> languages represent
things in memory. Since the type system ensures at compile time that you
aren&#8217;t misinterpreting values, you don&#8217;t need to validate it at runtime.</p>
<aside name="untyped">

<p>This is also how <em>untyped</em> languages like assembly and Forth store values.
Those languages leave it to the <em>user</em> to make sure they don&#8217;t write code
that misinterprets a value&#8217;s type. Not for the faint of heart!</p>
</aside>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s compact.</em> You can&#8217;t get any more efficient than storing just the
    bits you need for the value itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s fast.</em> Not having type tags implies you&#8217;re not spending cycles
    checking them at runtime either. This is one of the reasons
    statically-typed languages tend to be faster than dynamic ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s unsafe.</em> <span name="unsafe">This</span> is the real cost, of
    course. A bad chunk of bytecode that causes you misinterpret a value and
    treat a number like a pointer or vice versa can violate the security of
    your game or crash.</p>
<aside name="unsafe">

<p>If your bytecode was compiled from a statically-typed language, you
might think you&#8217;re safe here because the compiler won&#8217;t generate unsafe
bytecode. That may be true, but remember malicious users may hand-craft
evil bytecode without going through your compiler.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, for example, the Java Virtual Machine has to do <em>bytecode
verification</em> when it loads a program.</p>
</aside>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An interface:</strong></p>
<p>The object-oriented solution for a value that maybe be one of several
different types is through polymorphism. An interface provides virtual
methods for the various type tests and conversions, along the lines of:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Value</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">Value</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="n">ValueType</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">asInt</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Can only call this on ints.</span>
    <span class="n">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="c1">// Other conversion methods...</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then you have concrete classes for each specific data type, like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">IntValue</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Value</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="n">IntValue</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="n">ValueType</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">TYPE_INT</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">asInt</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s open-ended.</em> You can define new value types outside of the core VM
    as long as they implement the base interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s object-oriented.</em> If you adhere to OOP principles, this does
    things the &#8220;right&#8221; way and uses polymorphic dispatch for type-specific
    behavior instead of something like switching on a type tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s verbose.</em> You have to define a separate class with all of the
    associated ceremonial verbiage for each data type. Note that in the
    previous examples, we showed the entire definition of <em>all</em> of the value
    types. Here we only covered one!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s inefficient.</em> To get polymorphism, you have to go through a
    pointer, which means even tiny values like booleans and numbers get
    wrapped in objects that are allocated on the heap. Every time you touch
    a value, you have to do a virtual method call.</p>
<p>In something like the core of a virtual machine, small performance hits
like this quickly add up. In fact, this suffers from many of the
problems that caused us to avoid the Interpreter pattern, except now the
problem is in our <em>values</em> instead of our <em>code</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My recommendation: If you can stick with a single data type, do that. Otherwise,
do a tagged union. That&#8217;s what almost every language interpreter in the world
does.</p>
<h3><a href="#how-is-the-bytecode-generated" name="how-is-the-bytecode-generated">How is the bytecode generated?</a></h3>
<p>I saved the most important question for last. I&#8217;ve walked you through the code
to <em>consume</em> and <em>interpret</em> bytecode, but it&#8217;s up to you to build something to
<em>produce</em> it. The typical solution here is to write a compiler, but it&#8217;s not the
only option.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If you define a text-based language:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>You have to define a syntax.</em> Both amateur and professional language
    designers categorically underestimate how difficult this is to do.
    Defining a grammar that makes parsers happy is easy. Defining one that
    makes <em>users</em> happy is <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>Syntax design is user interface design, and that process doesn&#8217;t get
easier when you constrain the user interface to a string of characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You have to implement a parser.</em> Despite their reputation, this part is
    pretty easy. Either use a parser generator like ANTLR or Bison, or &#8212;
    like I do&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;hand-roll a little recursive descent one and you&#8217;re good to
    go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You have to handle syntax errors.</em> This is one of the most important
    and most difficult parts of the process. When users make syntax and
    semantic errors&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;which they will, constantly&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it&#8217;s your job to guide
    them back onto the right path. Giving helpful feedback isn&#8217;t easy when
    all you know is that your parser is sitting on some unexpected
    punctuation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It will likely turn off non-technical users.</em> We programmers like text
    files. Combined with powerful command-line tools, we think of them as
    the LEGO blocks of computing: simple but easily composable in a million
    ways.</p>
<p>Most non-programmers don&#8217;t think of text like that. To them, it feels
like filling in tax forms for a robotic auditor that yells at them if
they forget a single semicolon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you define a graphical authoring tool:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>You have to implement a user interface.</em> Buttons, clicks, drags, stuff
    like that. Some cringe at the idea of this, but I personally love it. If
    you go down this route, it&#8217;s important to treat designing the user
    interface as a core part of doing your job well, and not just an
    unpleasant task to be muddled through.</p>
<p>Every little bit of extra work you do here will make your tool easier
and more pleasant to use and that directly leads to better content in
your game. If you look behind many of the games you love, you&#8217;ll often
find the secret was fun authoring tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You have fewer error cases.</em> Because the user is building behavior
    interactively one step at a time, your application can guide them away
    from mistakes as soon as they happen.</p>
<p>With a text-based language, the tool doesn&#8217;t see <em>any</em> of the user&#8217;s
content until they throw an entire file at it. That makes it harder to
prevent and handle errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Portability is harder.</em> The nice thing about text compilers is that
    text files are <span name="lines">universal</span>. A simple compiler
    just reads in one file and writes one out. Porting that across operating
    systems is trivial.</p>
<aside name="lines">

<p>Except for line endings. <em>Sigh&#8230;</em></p>
</aside>

<p>When you&#8217;re building a UI, you have to choose which framework to use,
and many of those are specific to one OS. There are cross-platform UI
toolkits too, but those often get ubiquity at the expense of
familiarity: they feel equally weird on all of platforms.</p>

    composable behavior in terms of data.</p>
<p>In fact, you&#8217;ll often end up using <em>both</em> patterns. The tool you use to
generate bytecode will internally have a tree of objects that represents the
code. This is exactly what the Interpreter pattern expects.</p>
<p>In order to compile that to bytecode, you&#8217;ll recursively walk the tree, just
like you do to interpret it with the Interpreter pattern. The <em>only</em>
