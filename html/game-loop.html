<p>If there is one pattern this book couldn&#8217;t live without, this is it. Game loops
are the quintessential example of a &#8220;game programming pattern&#8221;. Almost every
game has one, no two are exactly alike, and relatively few programs outside of
games use them.</p>
<p>To see how they&#8217;re useful, let&#8217;s take a quick trip down memory lane. In the
olden days of computer programming when everyone had <span
name="beard">beards</span>, programs worked like your dishwasher: you dumped a
load of code in, pushed a button, waited, and got results out. Done. These were
<em>batch mode</em> programs: once the work was done, the program stopped.</p>
<aside name="beard">

<p>Ada Lovelace and Rear Admiral Grace Hopper had honorary beards.</p>
</aside>

<p>You still see these today, though we thankfully don&#8217;t have to write them on
punch cards any more. Shell scripts, command line programs, and even the little
Python script that turns a pile of Markdown into this book are all batch mode
programs.</p>
<h3><a href="#interview-with-a-cpu" name="interview-with-a-cpu">Interview with a CPU</a></h3>
<p>Eventually, programmers realized having to drop off a batch of code at the
computing office and come back a few hours later for the results was a terribly
slow way to get the bugs out of your program. They wanted immediate feedback.
<em>Interactive</em> programs were born. Some of the first interactive programs were
games:</p>

</pre></div>


<aside name="cave">

<p>This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Colossal Cave
Adventure</a>, the first
adventure game.</p>
</aside>

<p>You could have a live conversation with the program. It waited for your input,
then would respond to you. Then you would reply back, taking turns just like you
learned to do in kindergarten. When it was your turn, it sat there doing
nothing. Something like:</p>
<p><span name="exit"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">command</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">readCommand</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">handleCommand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="exit">

<p>This loops forever, so there&#8217;s no way to quit the game. A real game would do
something like <code>while (!done)</code> and set <code>done</code> to exit. I&#8217;ve omitted that to keep
things simple.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#event-loops" name="event-loops">Event loops</a></h3>
<p>Modern graphic UI applications look surprisingly similar to old adventure games
once you shuck their skin off. Your word processor usually just sits there doing
nothing until you press a key or click something:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">Event</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">event</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">waitForEvent</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">dispatchEvent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">event</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The main difference is that instead of <em>text commands</em>, the program is waiting
for <em>user input events</em>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;mouse clicks and key presses. It still works
basically like the old text adventures where the program <span
name="idle"><em>blocks</em></span> waiting for user input, which is a problem.</p>
<p>Unlike most other software, games keep moving even when the user isn&#8217;t providing
input. If you sit staring at the screen, the game doesn&#8217;t freeze. Animations
keep animating. Visual effects dance and sparkle. If you&#8217;re unlucky, that
monster keeps chomping on your hero.</p>
<aside name="idle">

<p>Most event loops do have &#8220;idle&#8221; events so you can intermittently do stuff
without user input. That&#8217;s good enough for a blinking cursor or a progress bar,
but too rudimentary for games.</p>
</aside>

<p>This is the first key part of a real game loop: <em>it processes user input, but
doesn&#8217;t wait</em> for it. The loop always keeps spinning:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">processInput</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">render</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We&#8217;ll refine this later, but the basic pieces are here. <code>processInput()</code> handles
any user input that&#8217;s happened since the last call. Then <span
name="update"><code>update()</code></span> advances the game simulation one step. It runs
AI and physics (usually in that order). Finally, <code>render()</code> draws the game so
the player can see what happened.</p>
<aside name="update">

<p>As you might guess from the name, <code>update()</code> is a good place to use the <a
href="update-method.html" class="pattern">Update Method</a> pattern.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#a-world-out-of-time" name="a-world-out-of-time">A world out of time</a></h3>
<p>If this loop isn&#8217;t blocking on input, that leads to the obvious question: how
<em>fast</em> does it spin? Each turn through the game loop advances the state of the
game by some amount. From the perspective of an inhabitant of the game world,
the hand of their clock has <span name="tick">ticked</span> forward.</p>
<aside name="tick">

<p>The common terms for one crank of the game loop are &#8220;tick&#8221; or &#8220;frame&#8221;.</p>
</aside>

<p>Meanwhile, the <em>player&#8217;s</em> actual clock is ticking. If we measure how quickly the
game loop cycles in terms of real time, we get the game&#8217;s &#8220;frames per second&#8221;.
If the game loop cycles quickly, the FPS is high and the game moves smoothly and
quickly. If it&#8217;s slow, the game jerks along like a stop motion movie.</p>
<p>With the crude loop we have now where it just cycles as quickly as it can, two
factors determine the frame rate. The first is <em>how much work it has to do each
frame</em>. Complex physics, a bunch of game objects, and lots of graphic detail all
will keep your CPU and GPU busy, and it will take longer to complete a frame.</p>
<p>The other is <em>the speed of the underlying platform.</em> Faster chips churn through
more code in the same amount of time. Multiple cores, GPUs, dedicated audio
hardware, and the OS&#8217;s scheduler all affect how much you get done in one tick.</p>
<h3><a href="#seconds-per-second" name="seconds-per-second">Seconds per second</a></h3>
<p>In early video games, that second factor was fixed. If you wrote a game for the
NES or Apple IIe, you knew <em>exactly</em> what CPU your game was running on and you
could (and did) code specifically for that. All you had to worry about was how
much work you did each tick.</p>
<p>Older games were carefully coded to do just enough work each frame so that the
game ran at the speed the developers wanted. But if you tried to play that same
game on a faster or slower <span name="turbo">machine</span>, then the game
itself would speed up or slow down.</p>
<aside name="turbo">

<p>This is why old PCs used to have
&#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button">turbo</a>&#8221; buttons. New PCs were
faster and couldn&#8217;t play old games because the game would run too fast. Turning
the turbo button <em>off</em> would slow the machine down and make the game playable.</p>
</aside>

<p>These days, though, few developers have the luxury of knowing exactly what
hardware their game will run on. Instead, our games must intelligently adapt to
a variety of devices.</p>
<p>This is the other key job of a game loop: <em>it runs the game at a consistent
speed despite differences in the underlying hardware.</em></p>
<h2><a href="#the-pattern" name="the-pattern">The Pattern</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>game loop</strong> runs continuously during gameplay. Each turn of the loop, it
<strong>processes user input</strong> without blocking, <strong>updates the game state</strong>, and
<strong>renders the game</strong>. It tracks the passage of time to <strong>control the rate of
gameplay</strong>.</p>
<h2><a href="#when-to-use-it" name="when-to-use-it">When to Use It</a></h2>
<p>Using the wrong pattern can be worse than using no pattern at all, so this
section is normally here to caution against over-enthusiasm. The goal of design
patterns isn&#8217;t just to cram as many into your codebase as you can.</p>
<p>But this pattern is a bit different. I can say with pretty good confidence that
you <em>will</em> use this pattern. If you&#8217;re using a game <span
name="engine">engine</span>, you won&#8217;t write it yourself, but it&#8217;s still there.</p>
<aside name="engine">

<p>For me, this is the difference between an &#8220;engine&#8221; and a &#8220;library&#8221;. With
libraries you own the main game loop and call into the library. An engine owns
the loop and calls into <em>your</em> code.</p>
</aside>

<p>You might think you won&#8217;t need this if you&#8217;re making a turn-based game. But even
there, though the <em>game state</em> won&#8217;t advance until the user takes their turn,
the <em>visual</em> and <em>audible</em> state of the game usually does. Animation and music
keep running even when it&#8217;s &#8220;waiting&#8221; for you to take your turn.</p>
<h2><a href="#keep-in-mind" name="keep-in-mind">Keep in Mind</a></h2>
<p>The loop we&#8217;re talking about here is some of the most important code in your
game. They say a program spends <span name="percent">90%</span> of its time in
10% of the code. Your game loop will be firmly in that 10%. Take care with this
code, and be mindful of its efficiency.</p>
<aside name="percent">

<p>Made up statistics like this are why &#8220;real&#8221; engineers like mechanical and
electrical don&#8217;t take us seriously.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#you-may-need-to-coordinate-with-the-platform's-event-loop" name="you-may-need-to-coordinate-with-the-platform's-event-loop">You may need to coordinate with the platform&#8217;s event loop</a></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re building your game on top of an OS or platform that has a graphic UI
and event loop built in, then you have <em>two</em> application loops in play. They&#8217;ll
need to play nice together.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you can just take control and make your loop the only one. For
example, if you&#8217;re writing a game against the venerable Windows API, your
<code>main()</code> can just have a game loop. Inside, you can call <code>PeekMessage()</code> to
handle and dispatch events from the OS. Unlike <code>GetMessage()</code>, <code>PeekMessage()</code>
doesn&#8217;t block waiting for user input so your game loop will keep cranking.</p>
<p>Other platforms don&#8217;t let you opt out of the event loop so easily. If you&#8217;re
targeting a web browser, the event loop is deeply built into browser&#8217;s execution
model. There, the event loop will run the show and you&#8217;ll use it as your game
loop too. You&#8217;ll call something like <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code> so that it will
call back into your code and keep the game running.</p>
<h2><a href="#sample-code" name="sample-code">Sample Code</a></h2>
<p>For such a long introduction, the code for a game loop is actually pretty
straightforward. We&#8217;ll walk through a couple of variations and go over their
good and bad points.</p>
<p>The game loop drives AI, rendering and other game systems, but those aren&#8217;t the
point of the pattern itself, so we&#8217;ll just call into fictitious methods here.
Actually implementing <code>render()</code>, <code>update()</code> and others is left as a
(challenging!) exercise for the reader.</p>
<h3><a href="#run,-run-as-fast-as-you-can" name="run,-run-as-fast-as-you-can">Run, run as fast as you can</a></h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve already seen the simplest possible game loop:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">processInput</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">render</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The problem with it is you have no control over how fast the game runs. On a
fast machine, that loop will spin so fast users won&#8217;t be able to see what&#8217;s
going on. On a slow machine, the game will crawl. If you have a part of the game
that&#8217;s content-heavy or does more AI or physics, the game will actually play
slower there.</p>
<h3><a href="#take-a-little-nap" name="take-a-little-nap">Take a little nap</a></h3>
<p>The first variation we&#8217;ll look at adds a simple fix. Say you want your game to
run at 60 FPS. That gives you about <span name="16">16</span> milliseconds per
frame. As long as you can reliably do all of your game processing and rendering
in less than that time, you can run at a steady frame rate. All you do is process
the frame and then <em>wait</em> until it&#8217;s time for the next one, like so:</p>
<p><img src="images/game-loop-simple.png"/></p>
<p>The code looks a bit like this:</p>
<aside name="16">

<p><em>1000 ms / FPS = ms per frame</em>.</p>
</aside>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">start</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getCurrentTime</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">processInput</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">render</span><span class="p">();</span>

  <span class="n">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">start</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">MS_PER_FRAME</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">getCurrentTime</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>sleep()</code> here makes sure the game doesn&#8217;t run too <em>fast</em> if it processes a
frame quickly. It <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> help if your game runs too <em>slowly</em>. If it takes
longer than 16ms to update and render the frame, your sleep time goes
<em>negative</em>. If we had computers that could travel back in time, lots of things
would be easier, but we don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Instead, the game slows down. You can work around this by doing less work each
frame: cut down on the graphics and razzle dazzle, or dumb down the AI. But that
impacts the quality of gameplay for all users, even ones on fast machines.</p>
<h3><a href="#one-small-step,-one-giant-step" name="one-small-step,-one-giant-step">One small step, one giant step</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s try something a bit more sophisticated. The problem we have basically
boils down to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each update advances game time by a certain amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It takes a certain amount of <em>real</em> time to process that.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If step two takes longer than step one, the game slows down. If it takes more
than 16 ms of processing to advance game time by 16ms, it can&#8217;t possibly keep
up. But if we can advance the game by <em>more</em> than 16ms of game time in a single
step, then we can update the game less frequently and still keep up.</p>
<p>The idea then is to choose a time step to advance based on how much <em>real</em> time
passed since the last frame. The longer the frame takes, the bigger steps the
game takes. It always keeps up with real time because it will take bigger and
bigger steps to get there. They call this a <em>variable</em> or <em>fluid</em> time step. It
looks like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">lastTime</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getCurrentTime</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">current</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getCurrentTime</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">elapsed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">current</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">lastTime</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">processInput</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">elapsed</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">render</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">lastTime</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">current</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Each frame, we determine how much <em>real</em> time passed since the last game update
(<code>elapsed</code>). When we update the game state, we pass that in. The engine is then
responsible for advancing the game world forward by that amount of time.</p>
<p>Say you&#8217;ve got a bullet shooting across the screen. With a fixed time step, each
frame you&#8217;ll move it according to its velocity. With a variable time step, you
<em>scale that velocity by the elapsed time</em>. As the time step gets bigger, the
bullet moves farther in each frame. That bullet will get across the screen in
the <em>same</em> amount of <em>real</em> time, even if it&#8217;s twenty small fast steps, or four
big slow ones.</p>
<p>This looks like a winner:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The game plays at a consistent rate on different hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players with faster machines are rewarded with smoother gameplay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But, alas, there&#8217;s a serious problem lurking ahead: we&#8217;ve made the game <span
name="deterministic">non-deterministic</span> and unstable. Here&#8217;s one example
of the trap we&#8217;ve set for ourselves:</p>
<aside name="deterministic">

<p>&#8220;Deterministic&#8221; means that every time you run the program, if you give it the
same inputs, you get the exact same outputs back. As you can imagine, it&#8217;s much
easier to track down bugs in deterministic programs: find the inputs that caused
the bug the first time, and you can cause it every time.</p>
<p>Computers are naturally deterministic: they follow programs mechanically.
Non-determinism appears when the messy real world creeps in. For example,
networking, the system clock, and thread scheduling all rely on bits of the
external world outside of the program&#8217;s control.</p>
</aside>

<p>Say we&#8217;ve got a two-player networked game and Fred has some beast of a gaming
machine while George is using his grandmother&#8217;s antique PC. That aforementioned
bullet is flying across both of their screens. On Fred&#8217;s machine, the game is
running super fast, so each time step is tiny. We cram, like, 50 frames in the
second it takes the bullet to cross the screen. Poor George can only fit about
five in.</p>
<p>This means on Fred&#8217;s machine, the physics engine updates the bullet&#8217;s position
50 times, but George&#8217;s only does it five times. Most games use floating point
numbers and those are subject to <em>rounding error</em>. Each time you add two
floating point numbers, the answer you get back can be a bit off. Fred&#8217;s machine
is doing ten times as many operations, so he&#8217;ll accumulate a bigger error than
George. The <em>same</em> bullet will end up in <em>different places</em> on their machines.</p>
<p>This is just one nasty problem a variable time step can cause, but there&#8217;s more.
In order to run in real-time, game physics engines are approximations of the
real laws of mechanics. To keep those approximations from <span
name="blowup">blowing up</span>, damping is applied. That damping is carefully
tuned to a certain time step. Vary that, and the physics gets unstable.</p>
<aside name="blowup">

<p>&#8220;Blowing up&#8221; is literal here. When a physics engine flakes out, objects can get
completely wrong velocities and launch themselves into the air.</p>
</aside>

<p>This instability is bad enough that this example is only here as a cautionary
tale and to lead us to something better&#8230;</p>
<h3><a href="#play-catch-up" name="play-catch-up">Play catch up</a></h3>
<p>One part of the engine that usually <em>isn&#8217;t</em> affected by a variable time step is
<span name="render">rendering</span>. Since the rendering engine captures an
instant in time, it doesn&#8217;t care how much time advanced since the last one. It
renders things wherever they happen to be right then.</p>
<aside name="render">

<p>This is more or less true. Things like motion blur can be affected by time step,
but if they&#8217;re a bit off, the player doesn&#8217;t usually notice.</p>
</aside>

<p>We can use this fact to our advantage. We&#8217;ll <em>update</em> the game using a fixed
time step because that makes everything simpler and more stable for physics and
AI. But we&#8217;ll allow flexibility in when we <em>render</em> in order to free up some
processor time.</p>
<p>It goes like this: A certain amount of real time has elapsed since the last turn
of the game loop. This is how much game time we need to simulate for the game&#8217;s
&#8220;now&#8221; to catch up with the player&#8217;s. We do that using a <em>series</em> of <em>fixed</em> time
steps. The code looks a bit like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">previous</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getCurrentTime</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">lag</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>There&#8217;s a few pieces here. At the beginning of each frame, we update <code>lag</code> based
on how much real time passed. This measures how far the game&#8217;s clock is behind
compared to the real world. We then have an inner loop to update the game one
fixed step at a time until it&#8217;s caught up. Once we&#8217;re caught up, we render and
start over again. You can visualize it sort of like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/game-loop-fixed.png"/></p>
<p>Note that the time step here isn&#8217;t the <em>visible</em> frame rate any more.
<code>MS_PER_UPDATE</code> is just the <em>granularity</em> we use to update the game. The shorter
this step is, the more processing time it takes to catch up to real time. The
longer it is, the choppier the gameplay is. Ideally, you want it pretty short,
often faster than 60 FPS, so that the game simulates with high fidelity on fast
machines.</p>
<p>But be careful not to make it <em>too</em> short. You need to make sure the time step
is greater than the time it takes to process an <code>update()</code>, even on the <span
name="bail">slowest</span> hardware. Otherwise, your game simply can&#8217;t catch up.</p>
<aside name="bail">

<p>I left it out here, but you can safeguard this by having the inner update loop
bail after a maximum number of iterations. The game will slow down then, but
that&#8217;s better than locking up completely.</p>
</aside>

<p>Fortunately, we&#8217;ve bought ourselves some breathing room here. The trick is that
we&#8217;ve <em>yanked rendering out of the update loop</em>. That frees up a bunch of CPU
time. The end result is the game <em>simulates</em> at a constant rate using safe fixed
time steps across a range of hardware. It&#8217;s just that the player&#8217;s <em>visible
window</em> into the game gets choppier on a slower machine.</p>
<h3><a href="#stuck-in-the-middle" name="stuck-in-the-middle">Stuck in the middle</a></h3>
<p>There&#8217;s one issue we&#8217;re left with, and that&#8217;s residual lag. We update the game
at a fixed time step, but we render at arbitrary points in time. This means that
from the user&#8217;s perspective, the game will often display at a point in time
between two updates.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a timeline:</p>
<p><img src="images/game-loop-timeline.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, we update at a nice tight, fixed interval. Meanwhile, we render
whenever we can. It&#8217;s less frequent than updating, and isn&#8217;t steady either. Both
of those are OK. The lame part is that we don&#8217;t always render right at the point
of updating. Look at the third render time. It&#8217;s right between two updates:</p>
<p><img src="images/game-loop-timeline-close.png" /></p>
<p>Imagine a bullet is flying across the screen. On the first update, it&#8217;s on the
left side. The second update moves it to the right side. The game is rendered at
a point in time right between those two updates, so the user expects to see that
bullet in the center of the screen. With our current implementation, it will
still just be on the left side. This means motion looks jagged or stuttery.</p>
<p>Conveniently, we actually know <em>exactly</em> how far between update frames we are
when we render: it&#8217;s stored in <code>lag</code>. We bail out of the update loop when it&#8217;s
less than the update time step, not when it&#8217;s <em>zero</em>. That leftover amount?
That&#8217;s how far into the next frame we are.</p>
<p>When we go to render, we&#8217;ll pass that in:</p>
<p><span name="normal"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lag</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">MS_PER_UPDATE</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="normal">

<p>We divide by <code>MS_PER_UPDATE</code> here to <em>normalize</em> the value. The value passed to
<code>render()</code> will vary from 0 (right at the previous frame) to just under 1.0
(right at the next frame), regardless of the update time step. This way, the
renderer doesn&#8217;t have to worry about the frame rate. It just deals in values
from 0 to 1.</p>
</aside>

<p>The renderer knows each game object <em>and its current velocity</em>. Say that bullet
is 20 pixels from the left side of the screen and is moving right 400 pixels per
frame. If we are halfway between frames, then we&#8217;ll end up passing 0.5 to
<code>render()</code>. So it draws the bullet half a frame ahead, at 220 pixels. Ta-da,
smooth motion.</p>
<p>Of course, it may turn out that that extrapolation is wrong. When we actually
calculate the next frame, we may discover the bullet hit an obstacle or slowed
down or something. We rendered its position interpolated between where it was on
the last frame and where we <em>think</em> it will be on the next frame. But we don&#8217;t
know that until we&#8217;ve actually done the full update with physics and AI.</p>
<p>So the extrapolation is a bit of a guess and sometimes ends up wrong.
Fortunately, though, those kinds of corrections aren&#8217;t usually noticeable. At
least, they&#8217;re less noticeable than the stuttering you get if you don&#8217;t
extrapolate at all.</p>
<h2><a href="#design-decisions" name="design-decisions">Design Decisions</a></h2>
<p>Despite the length of this chapter, I&#8217;ve left out more than I&#8217;ve included. Once
you throw in things like synchronizing with the display&#8217;s refresh rate,
multithreading, and GPUs, a real game loop can get pretty hairy. At a high
level, though, here are a few questions you&#8217;ll likely answer:</p>
<h3><a href="#do-you-own-the-game-loop,-or-does-the-platform" name="do-you-own-the-game-loop,-or-does-the-platform">Do you own the game loop, or does the platform?</a></h3>
<p>This is less a choice you make and more one that&#8217;s made for you. If you&#8217;re
making a game that runs in a web browser, you pretty much <em>can&#8217;t</em> write your own
classic game loop. The browser&#8217;s event-based nature precludes it. Likewise, if
you&#8217;re using an existing game engine, you will probably rely on its game loop
instead of rolling your own.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the platform&#8217;s event loop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s simple.</em> You don&#8217;t have to worry about writing and optimizing the
    core loop of the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It plays nice with the platform.</em> You don&#8217;t have to worry about
    explicitly giving the host time to process its own events, caching
    events, or otherwise managing the impedence mismatch between the
    platform&#8217;s input model and yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You lose control over timing.</em> The platform will call your code as it
    sees fit. If that&#8217;s not as frequently or as smoothly as you&#8217;d like, too
    bad. Worse, most application event loops weren&#8217;t designed with games in
    mind and usually <em>are</em> slow and choppy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a game engine&#8217;s loop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>You don&#8217;t have to write it.</em> Writing a game loop can get pretty tricky.
    Since that core code gets executed every frame, minor bugs or
    performance problems can have a large impact on your game. A tight game
    loop is one reason to consider using an existing engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You don&#8217;t get to write it.</em> Of course, the flip side to that coin is
    the loss of control if you <em>do</em> have needs that aren&#8217;t a perfect fit for
    the engine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write it yourself:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Total control.</em> You can do whatever you want with it. You can design it
    specifically for the needs of your game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You have to interface with the platform.</em> Application frameworks and
    operating systems usually expect to have a slice of time to process
    events and do other work periodically. If you own your app&#8217;s core loop,
    it won&#8217;t get any. You&#8217;ll have to explicitly hand off control
    periodically to make sure the framework doesn&#8217;t hang or get confused.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#how-do-you-manage-power-consumption" name="how-do-you-manage-power-consumption">How do you manage power consumption?</a></h3>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t an issue five years ago. Games ran on things plugged into walls or
dedicated handheld devices. But with the advent of smart phones, laptops, and
mobile gaming, the odds are good you do care about this now. A game that runs
beautifully but turns their phone into a space heater before running out of
juice thirty minutes later is not a game that makes people happy.</p>
<p>Now, you may need to think about making your game look great, but also use as
little CPU as possible. There will likely be an <em>upper</em> bound to performance
where you let the CPU sleep if you&#8217;ve done all the work you need to do in a
frame.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Run as fast as it can:</strong></p>
<p>This is what you&#8217;re likely to do for PC games (though even those are
increasingly being played on laptops). Your game loop will never explicitly
tell the OS to sleep. Instead, any spare cycles will be spent cranking up
the FPS or graphic fidelity.</p>
<p>This gives you the best possible gameplay experience but it&#8217;ll use as much
power as it can. If the player&#8217;s on a laptop, they&#8217;ll have a nice lap
warmer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clamp the framerate:</strong></p>
<p>Mobile games are often more focused on the quality of gameplay than they are
maximizing the detail of the graphics. Many of these games will set an upper
limit on the framerate (usually 30 or 60 FPS). If the game loop is done
processing before that slice of time is spent, it will just sleep for the
rest.</p>
<p>This gives the player a &#8220;good enough&#8221; experience and then goes easy on their
battery beyond that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#how-do-you-control-gameplay-speed" name="how-do-you-control-gameplay-speed">How do you control gameplay speed?</a></h3>
<p>A game loop has two key pieces: non-blocking user input, and adapting to the
passage of time. Input is straightforward. The magic is in how you deal with
time. There are a near <span name="platform">infinite</span> number of platforms
that games can run on and any single game may run on quite a few. How it
accommodates that variation is key.</p>
<aside name="platform">

<p>Game-making seems to be part of human nature, because every time we&#8217;ve built a
machine that can do computing, one of the first things we&#8217;ve done is made games
on it. The PDP-1 was a 2 kHz machine with only 4,096 words of memory yet Steve
Russell and co. managed to create Spacewar! on it.</p>
</aside>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fixed time step with no synchronization:</strong></p>
<p>This was our first sample code. You just run the game loop as fast as you
can.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s simple</em>. This is its main (well, only) virtue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Game speed is directly affected by hardware and game complexity.</em> And
    its main vice is that if there&#8217;s any variation, it will directly affect
    the game speed. It&#8217;s the fixie of game loops.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fixed time step with synchronization:</strong></p>
<p>The next step up on the complexity ladder is running the game at a fixed
time step, but adding a delay or synchronization point at the end of the
loop to keep the game from running too fast.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Still quite simple.</em> It&#8217;s only one line of code more than the
    probably-too-simple-to-actually-work example. In most game loops, you
    will likely do synchronization <em>anyway</em>. You will probably <a href="double-buffer.html">double
    buffer</a> your graphics and synchronize the buffer
    flip to the refresh rate of the display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s power-friendly.</em> This is a surprisingly important consideration
    for mobile games. You don&#8217;t want to kill the user&#8217;s battery
    unnecessarily. By simply sleeping for a few milliseconds instead of
    trying to cram ever more processing into each tick, you save power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The game doesn&#8217;t play too fast.</em> This fixes half of the speed concerns
    of a fixed loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The game can play too slow.</em> If it takes too long to update and render
    a game frame, playback will slow down. Because this style doesn&#8217;t
    separate updating from rendering, it&#8217;s likely to hit this sooner than
    more advanced options. Instead of just dropping <em>rendering</em> frames to
    catch up, gameplay will slow down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Variable time step:</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll put this in here as an option in the solution space, with the caveat
that most game developers I know recommend against it. It&#8217;s good to remember
<em>why</em> it&#8217;s a bad idea, though.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It adapts to playing both too slowly and too fast.</em> If the game can&#8217;t
    keep up with real time, it will just take larger and larger time steps
    until it does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It makes gameplay non-deterministic and unstable.</em> And this is the real
    problem, of course. Physics and networking in particular become much
    harder with a variable time step.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fixed update time step, variable rendering:</strong></p>
<p>The last option we covered in the sample code is the most complex but also
the most adaptable. It updates with a fixed time step, but can drop
<em>rendering</em> frames if it needs to to catch up to the player&#8217;s clock.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It adapts to playing both too slowly and too fast.</em> As long as the game
    can <em>update</em> in real time, the game won&#8217;t fall behind. If the player&#8217;s
    machine is top-of-the-line, it will respond with a smoother gameplay
    experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s more complex.</em> The main downside is there is a bit more going on
    in the implementation. You have to tune the update time step to be both
    as small as possible for the high-end, while not being too slow on the
    low end.</p>
