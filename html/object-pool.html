<h1>Object Pool</h1>
<h1 class="book"><a href="/">Game Programming Patterns</a><span class="section"><a href="optimization-patterns.html">Optimization Patterns</a></span></h1>
<h2><a href="#intent" name="intent">Intent</a></h2>
<p><em>Improve performance and memory use by reusing objects from a fixed pool instead
of allocating and freeing them individually.</em></p>
<h2><a href="#motivation" name="motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>We&#8217;re working on the visual effects for our game. When the hero casts a spell,
we want a shimmer of sparkles to burst across the screen. This calls for a
<em>particle system</em>: an engine that spawns little sparkly graphics and animates
them until they wink out of existence.</p>
<p>Since a single wave of the wand could cause hundreds of particles to be spawned,
our system needs to be able to create them very quickly. More importantly, we
need to make sure that creating and destroying these particles doesn&#8217;t cause
<em>memory fragmentation</em>.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-curse-of-fragmentation" name="the-curse-of-fragmentation">The curse of fragmentation</a></h3>
<p>Programming for a game console like the XBox 360 is closer to embedded
programming than conventional PC programming in many ways. Like embedded
programming, console games must run continuously for a very long time without
crashing or leaking memory and efficient compacting memory managers are rarely
available. In this environment memory fragmentation is deadly.</p>
<p>Fragmentation means the free space in our heap is <span
name="park">broken</span> into smaller pieces of memory instead of one large
open block. The <em>total</em> memory available may be large, but the largest
<em>contiguous</em> region might be painfully small. Say we&#8217;ve got fourteen bytes free,
but it&#8217;s fragmented into two seven-byte pieces with a chunk of in-use memory
between them. If we try to allocate a twelve-byte object, we&#8217;ll fail. No more
sparklies onscreen.</p>
<aside name="park">

<p>It&#8217;s like trying to parallel park on a busy street where the already parked cars
are spread out a bit too far. If they&#8217;d bunch up, there would be room, but the
free space is <em>fragmented</em> into bits of open curb between half a dozen cars.</p>
</aside>

<p><span name="heap"></span></p>
<p><img src="images/object-pool-heap-fragment.png" /></p>
<aside name="heap">

<p>Here&#8217;s how a heap becomes fragmented, and how it can cause an allocation to fail
even where there&#8217;s theoretically enough memory available.</p>
</aside>

<p>Even if fragmentation is infrequent, it can still <span
name="soak">gradually</span> reduce the heap to an unusable foam of open holes
and filled-in crevices, ultimately hosing the game completely.</p>
<aside name="soak">

<p>Most console makers require games to pass &#8220;soak tests&#8221; where they leave the game
running in demo mode for several days. If the game crashes, they don&#8217;t allow it
to ship. While soak tests sometimes fail because of a rarely-occurring bug, it&#8217;s
usually creeping fragmentation or memory leakage that brings the game down.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#the-best-of-both-worlds" name="the-best-of-both-worlds">The best of both worlds</a></h3>
<p>Because of fragmentation, and because allocation may be slow, games are very
careful about when and how they manage memory. A simple solution is often best:
grab a big chunk of memory when the game starts and don&#8217;t free it until the game
ends. But this is a pain for systems where we need to create and destroy things
while the game is running.</p>
<p>An object pool gives us the best of both worlds: to the memory manager, we&#8217;re
just allocating one big hunk of memory up front and not freeing it while the
game is playing. To the users of the pool, we can freely allocate and deallocate
objects to our heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<h2><a href="#the-pattern" name="the-pattern">The Pattern</a></h2>
<p>Define a <strong>pool</strong> class that maintains a collection of <strong>reusable objects</strong>.
Each object supports an <strong>&#8220;in use&#8221; query</strong> to tell if it is currently &#8220;alive.&#8221;
When the pool is initialized, it creates the entire collection of objects up
front (usually in a single contiguous allocation) and initializes them all to
the &#8220;not in use&#8221; state.</p>
<p>When you want a new object, ask the pool for one. It finds an available object,
initializes it to &#8220;in use&#8221; and returns it. When the object is no longer needed,
it is set back to the &#8220;not in use&#8221; state. This way, objects can be freely
created and destroyed without needing to allocate memory or other resources.</p>
<h2><a href="#when-to-use-it" name="when-to-use-it">When to Use It</a></h2>
<p>This pattern is used widely in games for obvious things like game entities and
visual effects, but also for less visible data structures such as currently
playing sounds. Use Object Pool when:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need to frequently create and destroy objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objects are similar in size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocating objects on the heap is slow or could lead to memory
    fragmentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each object encapsulates a resource such as a database or network connection
    that is expensive to acquire and could be reused.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#keep-in-mind" name="keep-in-mind">Keep in Mind</a></h2>
<p>You normally rely on a garbage collector or just <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to handle
memory management for you. By using an object pool, you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;I know
better how these bytes should be handled.&#8221; That means the onus is on you to deal
with this pattern&#8217;s limitations.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-pool-may-waste-memory-on-unneeded-objects" name="the-pool-may-waste-memory-on-unneeded-objects">The pool may waste memory on unneeded objects</a></h3>
<p>The size of an object pool needs to be tuned for the game&#8217;s needs. When tuning,
it&#8217;s usually obvious when the pool is too <em>small</em> (there&#8217;s nothing like a crash
to get your attention). But also take care that the pool isn&#8217;t too <em>big</em>. A
smaller pool frees up memory that could be used for other fun stuff.</p>
<h3><a href="#only-a-fixed-number-of-objects-can-be-active-at-any-one-time" name="only-a-fixed-number-of-objects-can-be-active-at-any-one-time">Only a fixed number of objects can be active at any one time</a></h3>
<p>In some ways this is a good thing. Partitioning memory into separate pools for
different types of objects ensures that, for example, a huge sequence of
explosions won&#8217;t cause your particle system to eat <em>all</em> of the available
memory, preventing something more critical like a new enemy from being created.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this also means being prepared for the possibility that your
attempt to reuse an object from the pool will fail because they are all in use.
There are a few common strategies to handle this.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Prevent it outright.</em> This is the most common &#8220;fix&#8221;: tune the pool sizes so
    that they never overflow regardless of what the user does. For pools of
    important objects like enemies or gameplay items, this is often the right
    answer. There may be no &#8220;right&#8221; way to handle the lack of a free slot to
    create the big boss when the player reaches the end of the level, so the
    smart thing to do is make sure that never happens.</p>
<p>The downside is that this can force you to sit on a lot of memory for object
slots that are needed only for a couple of rare edge cases. Because of this,
a single fixed pool size may not be the best fit for all game states. For
instance, some levels may feature effects prominently while others focus on
sound. In such cases, consider having pool sizes tuned differently for each
scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Just don&#8217;t create the object.</em> This sounds harsh, but it makes sense for
    cases like our particle system. If all particles are in use, the screen is
    probably full of flashing graphics. The user won&#8217;t notice if the next
    explosion isn&#8217;t quite as impressive as the ones currently going off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Forcibly kill an existing object.</em> Consider a pool for currently playing
    sounds, and assume you want to start a new sound but the pool is full. You
    do <em>not</em> want to simply ignore the new sound: the user will notice if their
    magical wand swishes dramatically <em>sometimes</em> and stay stubbornly silent
    other times. A better solution is to find the quietest sound already playing
    and replace that with our new sound. The new sound will mask the audible
    cutoff of the previous sound.</p>
<p>In general, if the <em>disappearance</em> of an existing object would be less
noticeable than the <em>absence</em> of a new one, this may be the right choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Increase the size of the pool.</em> If your game lets you be a bit more
    flexible with memory, you may be able to increase the size of the pool at
    runtime, or create a second overflow pool. If you do grab more memory in
    either of these ways, consider whether or not the pool should contract to
    its previous size when the additional capacity is no longer needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#memory-size-for-each-object-is-fixed" name="memory-size-for-each-object-is-fixed">Memory size for each object is fixed</a></h3>
<p>Most pool implementations store the objects in an array of in-place objects. If
all of your objects are of the same type, this is fine. However, if you want to
store objects of different types in the pool, or instances of subclasses that
may add fields, you need to ensure that each slot in the pool has enough memory
for the <em>largest</em> possible object. Otherwise, an unexpectedly large object will
stomp over the next one and trash memory.</p>
<p>At the same time, when your objects vary in size, you waste memory. Each slot
needs to be big enough to accommodate the largest object. If objects are rarely
that big, you&#8217;re throwing away memory every time you put a smaller one in that
slot. It&#8217;s like going through airport security and using a huge carry-on-sized
luggage tray just for your keys and wallet.</p>
<p>When you find yourself burning a lot of memory this way, consider splitting the
pool into <span name="pools">separate</span> pools for different sizes of
object&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;big trays for luggage, little trays for pocket stuff.</p>
<aside name="pools">

<p>This is a common pattern for implementing speed-efficient memory managers. The
manager has a number of pools of different block sizes. When you ask it to
allocate a block, it finds in an open slot in the pool of the appropriate size
and allocates from that pool.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#reused-objects-aren't-automatically-cleared" name="reused-objects-aren't-automatically-cleared">Reused objects aren&#8217;t automatically cleared</a></h3>
<p>Most memory managers have a debug feature that will clear freshly allocated or
freed memory to some obvious magic value like <code>0xdeadbeef</code>. This helps you find
painful bugs caused by uninitialized variables or using memory after it&#8217;s freed.</p>
<p>Since our object pool isn&#8217;t going through the memory manager any more when it
reuses an object, we lose that safety net. Worse, the memory used for a &#8220;new&#8221;
object previously held an object of the exact same type. This makes it nearly
impossible to tell if you forgot to initialize something when you created the
new object: the memory where the object is stored may already contain <em>almost</em>
correct data from its past life.</p>
<p>Because of this, pay special care that the code that initializes new objects in
the pool <em>fully</em> initializes the object. It may even be worth spending a bit of
time adding a debug feature that <span name="clear">clears</span> the memory for
an object slot when the object is reclaimed.</p>
<aside name="clear">

<p>I&#8217;d be honored if you clear it to <code>0x1deadb0b</code>.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#unused-objects-will-remain-in-memory" name="unused-objects-will-remain-in-memory">Unused objects will remain in memory</a></h3>
<p>Object pools are less common in systems that support garbage collection because
the memory manager will usually deal with fragmentation for you. But pools are
still useful there to avoid the cost of allocation and deallocation, especially
on mobile devices with slower CPUs and simpler garbage collectors.</p>
<p>If you do use an object pool there, beware of a potential conflict. Since the
pool doesn&#8217;t actually deallocate objects when they&#8217;re no longer in use, they
remain in memory. If they contain references to <em>other</em> objects, it will prevent
the collector from reclaiming those too. To avoid this, when a pooled object is
no longer in use, clear any references it has to other objects.</p>
<h2><a href="#sample-code" name="sample-code">Sample Code</a></h2>
<p>Real-world particle systems will often apply gravity, wind, friction, and other
physical effects. Our much simpler sample will just move particles in a straight
line for a certain number of frames and then kill the particle. Not exactly film
caliber, but it should illustrate how to use an object pool.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with the simplest possible implementation. First up is the little
particle class:</p>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The default constructor initializes the particle to &#8220;not in use.&#8221; A later call
to <code>init()</code> initializes the particle to a live state.</p>
<p>Particles are animated over time using the unsurprisingly named <code>animate()</code>
function, which should be called once per frame.</p>
<p>The pool needs to know which particles are available for reuse. It gets this
from the particle&#8217;s <code>inUse()</code> function. It takes advantage of the fact that
particles have a limited lifetime, and uses the <code>_framesLeft</code> variable to
discover which particles are in use without having to store a separate flag.</p>
<p>The pool class is also simple:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ParticlePool</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>

<p>The <code>create()</code> function lets external code create new particles. The game calls
<span name="update"><code>animate()</code></span> once per frame, which in turn animates
each particle in the pool.</p>
<aside name="update">

<p>This <code>animate()</code> method is an example of the <a href="update-method.html"
class="pattern">Update Method</a> pattern.</p>
</aside>

<p>The particles themselves are simply stored in a fixed-size array in the class.
In this sample implementation, the pool size is hardcoded in the class
declaration, but this could be defined externally by using a dynamic array of a
given size, or using a value template parameter.</p>

<p>We iterate through the pool looking for the first available particle. When we
find it, we initialize it and we&#8217;re done. Note that in this implementation, if
there aren&#8217;t any available particles, we simply don&#8217;t create a new one.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all there is to a simple particle system, aside from rendering the
particles, of course. We can now create a pool, and create some particles using
it. The particles will automatically deactivate themselves when their lifetime
has expired.</p>
<p>This is good enough to ship a game, but keen eyes may have noticed that creating
a new particle requires <span name="create">iterating</span> through
(potentially) the entire collection until we find an open slot. If the pool is
very large and mostly full, that can get slow. Let&#8217;s see how we can improve
that.</p>
<aside name="create">

<p>Creating a particle has <em>O(n)</em> complexity, for those of us who remember our
algorithms class.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#a-free-list" name="a-free-list">A free list</a></h3>
<p>If we don&#8217;t want to waste time <em>finding</em> free particles, the obvious answer is
to not lose track of them. We could store a separate list of pointers to each
unused particle. Then, when we need to create a particle, we just remove the
first pointer from the list and reuse the particle it points to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this would require us to maintain an entire separate array with
as many pointers as there are objects in the pool. After all, when we first
create the pool, <em>all</em> particles are unused, so the list would initially have a
pointer to every object in the pool.</p>
<p>It would be nice to fix our performance problems <em>without</em> sacrificing any
memory. Conveniently, there is some memory already lying around we can borrow:
the data for the unused particles themselves.</p>
<p>When a particle isn&#8217;t in use, most of its state is irrelevant. Its position and
velocity aren&#8217;t being used. The only state it needs is the stuff required to
tell if it&#8217;s dead. In our example, that&#8217;s the <code>_framesLeft</code> member. All those
other bits can be reused. Here&#8217;s a revised particle:</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve gotten all of the member variables except for <code>framesLeft_</code> and moved them
into a <code>live</code> struct inside a <code>state_</code> <span name="union">union</span>. This
struct holds the particle&#8217;s state when it&#8217;s being animated. When the particle is
unused, the other case of the union, the <code>next</code> member, is used. It holds a
pointer to the next available particle after this one.</p>
<aside name="union">

<p>Unions don&#8217;t seem to be used that often these days, so the syntax may be
unfamiliar to you. If you&#8217;re on a game team, you&#8217;ve probably got a &#8220;memory
guru,&#8221; that beleaguered compatriot whose job it is to come up with a solution
when the game has inevitably blown its memory budget. Ask them about unions.
They&#8217;ll know all about them and other fun bit-packing tricks.</p>
</aside>

<p>We can use these pointers to build a linked list that chains together every
unused particle in the pool. We have the list of available particles we need,
but didn&#8217;t need to use any additional memory. Instead, we cannibalize the memory
of the dead particles themselves to store the list.</p>
<p>This clever technique is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_list"><em>free
list</em></a>. For it to work, we need to make
sure the pointers are initialized correctly and are maintained when particles
are created and destroyed. And, of course, we need to keep track of the list&#8217;s
head:</p>

<p>There you go, a nice little object pool with constant-time creation and
deletion.</p>
<h2><a href="#design-decisions" name="design-decisions">Design Decisions</a></h2>
<p>As you&#8217;ve seen, the simplest object pool implementation is almost trivial:
create an array of objects and reinitialize them as needed. Production code is
rarely that minimal. There are several ways to expand on that to make the pool
more generic, safer to use, or easier to maintain. As you implement pools in
your games, you&#8217;ll need to answer these questions:</p>
<h3><a href="#are-objects-coupled-to-the-pool" name="are-objects-coupled-to-the-pool">Are objects coupled to the pool?</a></h3>
<p>The first question you&#8217;ll run into when writing an object pool is whether the
objects themselves know they are in a pool. Most of the time they will, but you
won&#8217;t have that luxury when writing a generic pool class that can hold arbitrary
objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If objects are coupled to the pool:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The implementation is simpler.</em> You can simply put an &#8220;in use&#8221; flag or
    function in your pooled object and be done with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You can ensure that the objects can only be created by the pool.</em> In
    C++, a simple way to do this is to make the pool class a friend of the
    object class, and then make the object&#8217;s constructor private.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Particle</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">friend</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ParticlePool</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This relationship documents the intended way to use the class and
ensures your users don&#8217;t create objects that aren&#8217;t tracked by the pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You may be able to avoid storing an explicit &#8220;in use&#8221; flag.</em> Many
    objects already retain some state that could be used to tell whether it
    is alive or not. For example, a particle may be available for reuse if
    its current position is offscreen. If the object class knows it may be
    used in a pool, it can provide an <code>inUse()</code> method to query that state.
    This saves the pool from having to burn some extra memory storing a
    bunch of &#8220;in use&#8221; flags.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If objects are not coupled to the pool:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Objects of any type can be pooled.</em> This is the big advantage. By
    decoupling objects from the pool, you may be able to implement a generic
    reusable pool class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The &#8220;in use&#8221; state must be tracked outside the objects.</em> The simplest
    way to do this is by creating a separate bit field.</p>

<h3><a href="#what-is-responsible-for-initializing-the-reused-objects" name="what-is-responsible-for-initializing-the-reused-objects">What is responsible for initializing the reused objects?</a></h3>
<p>In order to reuse an existing object, it must be reinitialized with new state. A
key question here is whether to reinitialize the object inside the pool class or
outside.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If the pool reinitializes internally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The pool can completely encapsulate its objects</em>. Depending on the
    other capabilities your objects need, you may be able to keep them
    completely internal to the pool. This makes sure that other code doesn&#8217;t
    maintain references to objects that could be unexpectedly reused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The pool is tied to how objects are initialized</em>. A pooled object may
    offer multiple functions that initialize it. If the pool manages
    initialization, its interface needs to support all of those and forward
    them to the object.</p>
